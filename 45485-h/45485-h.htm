<h1 class='c001'>THE SKY TRAIL</h1>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Gray clouds of winter hung over the city
as the noon edition of the <em>Atkinson News</em>
roared off the press.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim Murphy, famous young flying reporter
and aviation editor of the <em>News</em>,
pecked away half-heartedly at his typewriter
trying to write a story about a minor
automobile accident that had happened a
few minutes before in front of the <em>News</em>
building.</p>

<p class='c004'>The raw, damp weather and the lead-colored
sky had a depressing effect on Tim.
He felt earthbound, restless, and he longed
to soar through the clouds in the <em>Good
News</em>, the trim, fast biplane owned by the
paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you looking so gloomy
about?” asked Ralph Graves, who had been
Tim’s flying companion on many an aerial
adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This weather is enough to give anyone
a grouch,” replied Tim. “Here it is,
almost spring, and we have to get a week of
sloppy weather that spoils all our plans.
That job of overhauling the <em>Good News</em>
and installing the new motor will be done
today but it won’t do us any good. With
weather like this we won’t get any flying
assignments.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know just how you feel,” sympathized
Ralph, “Ive been out chasing the fire
trucks on a couple of chimney fires and I’ve
slopped through all the mud and slush I’m
going to for one day. Gosh! But I’d like
to hop over a few clouds in the <em>Good
News</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The telephone on Tim’s desk rang and he
turned to answer. He was smiling when
he swung back and faced Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dash off your copy,” he said. “Carl
Hunter, the manager at the airport, just
phoned that the <em>Good News</em> is ready for a
test flight. If we cut lunch this noon we’ll
have time for a short hop. What say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t ask foolish questions,” grinned
Ralph. He hurried to his typewriter where
his fingers were soon beating a tattoo on
flying keys as he wrote the story of the fires.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph finished his story, turned it in at
the copy desk, and was on his way to rejoin
Tim when a deep rumble shook the building.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Earthquake!” shouted one of the copy
boys as he dove under a desk.</p>

<p class='c004'>The windows rattled in their frames and
the entire building shook as the terrific
noise continued. Then a great pall of black
smoke could be seen mounting skyward.
The building ceased its trembling, the copy
boy scrambled out from under the desk and
the telephones voiced their sharp cries.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was the first to answer. From his
attitude others in the news room sensed
some major disaster. The managing editor,
George Carson, human dynamo of the paper,
ran to Tim’s desk and leaned close to
the receiver. He could hear the words
which were being shouted into the transmitter
at the other end of the line.</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor turned to Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Run to the composing room,” he cried.
“Tell them to stand by for an extra. The
storage tanks on the Midwest Oil Company
property west of town have caught fire and
are exploding.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph waited to hear no more, but ran
to the composing room where he gave the
managing editor’s message to the foreman.
Then he hurried back to the editorial office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was scribbling a bulletin for the
extra with one hand while he listened to
the first report of the explosion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five or six men were missing. They
might have been caught in the first blast
or perhaps they had escaped and were too
excited to report their safety.</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor took the story as
fast as Tim could write it, wrote a new banner
line for the front page, and rushed the
copy to the composing room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s talking?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One of the mechanics from the airport,”
said Tim. “The storage tanks are
only a mile and a half from the field and
he saw the first one let go. A man from
the oil company is at the field now and they
are getting the story from him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is the <em>Good News</em> in condition to fly?”
asked the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just got word a few minutes ago she
was ready to test,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it safe to go up on a picture assignment
for photos of those burning oil
tanks?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you’ll pay for all the paint I scorch
off the plane,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll pay for it,” cried Carson. “Take
Ralph with you and get all the pictures
you can. We’ll want them for the city
final. And whatever you do, don’t let your
motor cut out when you’re over those burning
tanks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it does you’ll have to look for two
new reporters,” chuckled Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim turned the telephone over to another
reporter and they stopped only long
enough to get a camera and make sure that
it had a plentiful supply of plates.</p>

<p class='c004'>The editorial office was in an uproar.
Carson was shouting orders at everyone who
came within hearing distance; reporters
were running from the room, starting for
the scene of the explosion; others were hastening
to hospitals where injured might
have been taken and one was delving into
the files to compare the present disaster
with fires of other years.</p>

<p class='c004'>A heavy pall of oily, black smoke blanketed
the city and some streets were so dark
the street lights had been turned on.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph ran to the nearby garage
where the cars used by <em>News</em> Reporters
were stored. They took the first machine
available, a light, speedy roadster. Tim
climbed behind the wheel and they shot out
of the garage. Traffic down town was
in a tangled jam that would take an hour to
clear for the rumbling explosions from the
oil tanks had alarmed the entire city.
Many people, believing that the city was
about to fall on their heads, had hurried
to their cars in an attempt to flee to the
open country. Now they were just as anxious
to return to their homes.</p>

<p class='c004'>By sliding through alleys, Tim managed
to get to a fairly clear boulevard that led
to the airport. A light breeze had started
to clear the smoke from the air and Tim
stepped on the accelerator. The indicator
on the speedometer climbed steadily—forty,
forty-five and fifty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look out,” cried Ralph, “Or we’ll be
picked up for speeding.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No chance,” replied Tim. “All the
police are at the fire. We’ve got to make
time if we want good pictures.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph were supremely happy
as they sped toward the airport. They
were going into the clouds again—into the
clouds in quest of the news and the pictures.
Barely a year before the <em>News</em> had purchased
an airplane and Tim had been
assigned the duties of flying reporter. Ralph
had been selected to help and Tim had
trained his friend as a flyer. Together they
had uncovered some of the biggest stories
of the year for the <em>News</em> and their exploits
had become exceedingly popular with the
people of Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c004'>In their first year of following the sky
trails they had flown across the top of the
world to prove that the ice and snow of the
Arctic did not cover a hitherto unknown
continent; Tim had flown down into Old
Mexico and secured exclusive photographs
of a rebel leader; and together they had
brought about the death of the Sky Hawk,
a former German war ace who had preyed
on the air lines of the middle west.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now they were off on a new adventure
and their hearts beat faster as they neared
the airport.</p>

<p class='c004'>To their right great billows of smoke
mounted skyward from the burning storage
tanks and occasionally tongues of flame
could be seen as the fire made some new
conquest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The airport was just beyond the city
limits and its administration building and
hangars flanked the boulevard. Tim spun
the roadster through the gate and stopped
beside hanger No. 5.</p>

<p class='c004'>The broad doors of the hangar had been
rolled open and the <em>Good News</em>, its nose
pointed toward the field, was waiting for
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The metal propeller was turning slowly
as the engine idled. The fuselage had been
painted a brilliant crimson with the wings
a contrast in silver grey.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carl Hunter, quiet, efficient manager of
the field, was waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How does the new engine sound?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mighty sweet,” replied Hunter. “I
haven’t had her up for I knew you would
want the first flight. However, I gave her
a thorough test on the blocks and she never
missed a stroke. Boy, you’ve got some
plane with that new 250 horsepower radial
motor. You’ll do 200 miles an hour and
have plenty of power to spare.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They hastened to the plane where Tim
and Ralph made a quick but thorough inspection.
The biplane had been overhauled
and re-rigged during the winter with a new,
more powerful motor. The <em>Good News</em>
would be fifty miles an hour faster.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporters climbed into their
cockpits. Ralph, who was to handle
the camera, took the forward cockpit and
Tim handled the controls in the rear one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim opened the throttle and listened attentively
as he ran the motor up and down
the scale. There was never a second’s hesitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter came close and shouted in Tim’s
ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t get too close to the fire,” he cried.
“The heat will raise the dickens with the
air and it will be pretty rocky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim nodded and motioned for the blocks
to be cleared away.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> rolled easily out of the
hangar, flipped its tail saucily at the few
mechanics left at the field, and roared over
the soggy ground and into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim thrilled to the touch of the controls
and the <em>Good News</em> answered even to the
slightest movement of the stick.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new motor settled to its work in a
manner that warmed Tim’s heart. He felt
that he had reserve power for any emergency
as he swung the biplane around and
headed for the burning oil tanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim put the <em>Good News</em> in a steady
climb and they gained altitude rapidly. At
1,200 feet he levelled off and Ralph got
busy with the camera.</p>

<p class='c004'>The oil storage lot, a large tract of level
land, was dotted with a dozen large tanks.
Five of the tanks had caught fire and exploded,
the force of the explosion knocking
off the steel tops. These tops, like
great black pancakes, had been blown clear
of the tract. One of them had hurtled
down to crush the roof of the house nearest
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The walls of two of the tanks had given
way and Tim and Ralph could see the firemen
fighting desperately to stop the spread
of the flames. Safety trenches had been
a part of the protective system at the tank
farm, but some of them had been weakened
by the explosion and the flaming gasoline
was finding the vulnerable spots.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim swung the <em>Good News</em> over the
blazing storage tanks and even 1,200 feet
in the air they could feel the heat. The
plane danced crazily and Ralph, who had
been leaning far out, clutched the side of
the plane and shook his fist at Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter snapped off the
throttle and they glided down on a gentle
incline, as the propeller turned slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Got enough pictures?” yelled Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three more plates left,” shouted
Ralph. “Let’s go down where I can get
some close ups. Make a run for the fire
at about four hundred feet; then zoom up
just before we get there. That will give
us some real pictures.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Also scorch all the new paint off the
ship,” protested Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Carson said he’d pay for a new coat,”
Ralph reminded him and Tim nodded and
snapped on the switches again. The motor
roared into action and they shot down out
of the murky sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>At four hundred feet Tim pulled back
on the stick and the <em>Good News</em> levelled
off. They were a mile west of the burning
tank farm when he banked sharply and
swung back toward the city.</p>

<p class='c004'>The clouds of smoke, rolling upward,
were streaked with vivid flashes of flame.
Tim chilled as he thought of the fate that
would be theirs if their plane failed to
respond to the controls. He forced the
thought from his mind and took a fresh
grip on the stick.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph glanced back and smiled. Tim
motioned to his own safety belt and directed
Ralph to strap himself into the
plane. No telling what might happen in
the next smoky-flame seared seconds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim pushed the <em>Good News</em> into several
tight banks while Ralph strapped himself
into the plane. Then they were ready for
their picture making dash.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph trained his camera and glued his
eyes to the sight. It would be a great action
picture, awe inspiring in its power,
if they could get it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim, one hand on the stick and the other
on the throttle, watched his air speed. It
was increasing rapidly. Half a mile from
the burning tanks they were going one hundred
and fifty miles an hour. A quarter
of a mile away and their speed had increased
to one hundred and seventy-five.
Then there was no more time to check the
air speed. They were going fast enough
and Tim knew his motor had plenty of
reserve power for any emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, in the forward cockpit, was busy
with his camera. Two exposures of the
rolling, mass of smoke and flame were made
in the split seconds before Tim threw the
<em>Good News</em> into a steep zoom.</p>

<p class='c004'>The towering pillar of smoke was less
than five hundred feet ahead of their propeller
when Tim put the pressure on the
stick. The nose shot skyward and the
<em>Good News</em> danced upward along the outer
rim of smoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph was ready for the final exposure
when a terrific explosion and a wave of
rag flame and heat tore the heavens asunder.
The <em>Good News</em> leaped upward,
bucking like a wild horse. Tim, his eyebrows
singed and lungs burning from the
scorching heat, fought the controls.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up, up, up pitched the <em>Good News</em>,
tossing wildly on the edge of the inferno
of flame and smoke. The noise of the explosion
had deadened their ears and neither
Ralph nor Tim could hear the laboring
of the motor as Tim gave it full throttle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new paint on the wings and fuselage
curled and darkened in the heat and for a
second Tim thought the gasoline tank
might explode.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then above it all came the sound of a
second explosion and the <em>Good News</em> stood
up on its tail. Tim was thankful that they
had used their safety belts for he was almost
thrown from the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Out of the smoke hurtled a great piece
of steel. Tim heard Ralph scream a warning
but he was powerless. The <em>Good News</em>
was out of control.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fascinated by the sight of the great projectile
which was approaching them with
terrifying speed, Tim lived an eternity.
Actually it might have been a second, probably
it was less.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em>, falling tail downward,
missed the deadly piece of steel by less than
two feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were past one danger only to be
confronted with another even more horrible
to contemplate than the one they had
just escaped. Ralph, his eyes burning in
his smoke-blackened face, was looking back
at Tim, trusting that the young flyer would
be able to pull the <em>Good News</em> out of the
tailspin.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a last despairing effort Tim
crashed his fist against the throttle. It
leaped ahead a good inch. It had jammed
in the emergency and he had not noticed
it. More fuel flooded into the laboring
cylinders and the motor, its full power unlashed,
lifted them almost vertically into
the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they were out of danger and in
the cool, clean air, Tim brought the nose
of the plane down and they headed for the
airport.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> looked to be ready to
take first prize at a fire sale. The entire
ship was grimy from the heavy oil smoke
and the dope on the wings and fuselage was
curled and cracked from the terrific heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim nosed down over the airport and
idled his motor as they skimmed to a perfect
three point landing and rolled to a
stop in front of their hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carl Hunter ran to their plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You crazy news hounds,” he cried. “I
thought you were goners when those explosions
caught you. How did you ever get
out alive?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll thank the new motor for saving
our necks,” replied Tim. “We were in
trouble, believe me. The throttle stuck
and the engine wasn’t getting all the gas.
In a moment of desperation I smashed the
throttle with my fist and opened it. A
second later and we were climbing to
safety.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing you made me strap myself
in,” grinned Ralph, “Or you would have
lost your passenger when we took that wild
west ride.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were mighty lucky to get back,”
said Tim. “Next time we cover a fire on
an oil tank farm we’ll know enough to stay
at a safe distance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But think of the great action pictures
we’ve got,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m thinking of my own neck right
now,” replied Tim. “When the second
explosion came and that piece of steel
picked us out for a target I just said good-bye
to everything. While we’re passing
around the thanks for getting out alive
we’ll have to include old lady gravity. The
<em>Good News</em> was dropping earthward just
fast enough for us to escape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d better get these pictures to the
office so they can use them in the final,”
said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You take the camera and the car and
go on,” said Tim. “I won’t be needed at
the office for a while and I want to check
over the plane and see if it suffered any
serious damage. Tell Carson he’ll have to
okay an order for another coat of paint.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll wait and see how the pictures come
out before I tell him,” chuckled Ralph as
he got in the roadster and started for the
office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Hunter went over the <em>Good
News</em> carefully, checking every joint and
strut. Then they gave the motor a thorough
test. It was sweet and true.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A real plane,” was the field manager’s
comment when they had completed their
inspection. “After a test like the one to-day
you can count on it carrying you
through anything short of a hurricane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not so sure it wouldn’t do that,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d better fill up the gasoline tank,”
he added. “Never can tell when we may
get an assignment that will call for another
quick getaway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They refueled the ship and were rolling
it back into the hangar when a car
skidded through the gate. The managing
editor and Ralph were in the machine and
from their haste Tim knew that he would
soon be in the clouds again on the trail of
another big story.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The managing editor of the <em>News</em> jumped
from the car before Ralph brought it to a
stop and ran toward Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you start on another assignment
right away?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whenever you say, Mr. Carson,” replied
Tim. “We’ve just made a complete
check and the <em>Good News</em> isn’t hurt in the
least. She’s refueled and ready to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you’re heading for Cedar river
valley,” said the managing editor. “Here’s
the situation. The village of Auburn you
took food and medical supplies to last
spring when the Cedar was on a rampage
is in need of help again. The river is causing
trouble and the worst ice jam in the
history of the country is just above the
village. This changeable weather has kept
the river thawing and then freezing and
thousands of tons of ice are piling up behind
the jam. I want you and Ralph to
make a trip there this afternoon, survey the
situation, get all the pictures you can, and
report to me. When we know the size of
the jam we can plan to get relief to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll be on our way in ten minutes,”
promised Tim. “The people at Auburn
helped me when I was working on the Sky
Hawk mystery and I’ll be glad of the
chance to do another favor for them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the excitement of this new story,”
said the managing editor, “I almost forgot
to tell you how much I appreciate your fine
work in getting the pictures of the fire at
the oil tanks. I’ve never seen anything
like them for action. They were so good
we put out an extra with nothing but pictures
on the front page. Biggest selling
extra ever published in Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They may prove fairly expensive by the
time you pay the cost of a new coat of paint
for the <em>Good News</em>,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hang the cost of the paint,” exclaimed
the managing editor, “Those pictures were
worth $500 to the paper. Why the one
showing that piece of steel hurtling up out
of the smoke and flame is the best action
picture ever taken.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The what!” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The picture showing that piece of steel
coming toward you,” repeated Carson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll explain,” said Ralph, and he turned
to Tim. “We had a lucky break,” he continued.
“When that explosion caught us
I had only one plate left in the camera. In
the excitement I snapped the shutter and
it so happened that the camera was aimed
to get that steel plate that almost wrote
'finish’ for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll be able to sell that picture all
over the country,” said the managing editor,
“And I’ll see that you boys get half
of whatever the paper makes on it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Carl Hunter came out of the administration
building to report that the weather
in the direction of Cedar Valley was fair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better get into some heavier clothes,”
he warned, “For it will be pretty breezy
up there if Tim decides to step on the gas.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our winter flying outfits are all in
town,” said Ralph. “Guess we can make
it this way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got some spare clothes,” suggested
Hunter. “Some of them belong to 'Tiny’
Lewis but they’ll keep you warm at least.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young reporters laughed at the
thought of wearing “Tiny” Lewis’ flying
togs. “Tiny,” was the exact opposite from
his name. He was as round as a barrel and
not much over five feet six in height.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys followed Hunter back to the
administration building and made their
way to the pilots’ room. Hunter opened
several lockers and finally found the clothes
he sought, heavy fleece-lined coveralls especially
designed for cold weather flying.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the boys had donned their ill-fitting
clothes they looked like a pair of
aerial scare crows for their legs projected
awkwardly from the suits, which were far
too short for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Throw a couple of robes over your legs
and you’ll be all right,” suggested the field
manager.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not for me,” grinned Tim. “Ralph
can bundle up all he wants to but I’m not
going to have a blanket tangled around the
stick just about the time I have to get into
action.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the boys returned to No. 5 hangar
the mechanics had the <em>Good News</em> warmed
up and on the line.</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor looked at his
watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just a few minutes after one-thirty,”
he said, half to himself, half to his star reporters.
Then aloud he said, “You won’t
be able to get to Auburn, snap your pictures
and get back here in time for the city final.
However, if you get some good shots we’ll
put out a five o’clock picture extra so step
on it all the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll be back in less than two hours,”
promised Tim. “Wouldn’t be able to do it
with the old motor in the ship, but with
this new power unit we’ll do 180 an hour
steady over and back. The trip is about
125 miles each way and with the time it
takes for the pictures we’ll make it in two
hours easy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll have the engravers and the
composing room stand by for a five o’clock
picture extra,” said the managing editor.
“This will be a red-letter day in the history
of the <em>News</em>—two picture extras in the
same day and believe me, boys, that’s what
the readers want. Pictures, action, and
more pictures. Now get going.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph lifted his big camera into the
front cockpit and settled himself for the
trip. He wrapped a heavy robe around his
legs for he knew Tim was going to tear
loose on the trip to Auburn and even though
it was moderately warm on the ground the
air at two thousand feet would be chilly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim checked his instruments, waved for
the mechanics to get in the clear, and
opened his throttle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> lifted her tail off the
muddy field, splattered the water out of
half a dozen puddles, and then shot up
into her own domain.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new radial motor, tested in flame
and smoke little more than an hour before,
leaped to its task and they sped away into
the east. Behind them the fire still raged
at the oil tanks, but firemen appeared to
have checked its spread.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim pushed the throttle steadily forward
until the air speed indicator registered 175
miles an hour. At 2,000 feet the ground
was a dull, gray checkerboard beneath
them. In places there were splotches of
dirty snow, a last vestige of winter. Creeks,
silver ribbons winding through the
countryside, were running bankfull of
water. Several times they sighted streams
in which the outgoing ice had jammed
around some bridge or sharp curve. Behind
these jams the stream had spread out
until it formed a small lake. None of
them were of major importance but at one
bridge half a dozen men were busy trying
to dynamite the mass of ice which was
threatening the safety of the structure.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they neared the valley of the mighty
Cedar the country became rougher and
there were fewer fields for an emergency
landing. A plane in trouble in the valley
would have small chance of making a safe
descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were fifteen miles from Auburn
when they caught their first glimpse of the
river, a great lake stretching for miles up
its valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then they saw the jumbled mass of ice
above the village. The towering blocks
had jammed at a sharp bend in the river
and hundreds of tons of ice, born by the
spring freshets, had built a great dam
which was impounding the waters of the
river.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bed of the stream below the ice jam
carried little more than a trickle of water
when compared to the usual volume.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the position of the jam Tim could
see that unless the pressure was relieved
soon the water behind the ice, spreading
out over the valley, would soon creep
around the wings of the jam and sweep
down on the village.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> slid down out of the
clouds and swung over the scene of the impending
disaster. The village was practically
deserted. Men and women were at
the jam, working side by side in what appeared
a futile effort to start the thousands
of tons of ice moving down stream before
their own homes were destroyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim guided the <em>Good News</em> up the valley,
over the jam, and on up stream. The
jam of ice extended nearly a half mile
above the village. The river above that
point, running free, was piling more ice on
the jam, adding to the pressure which
hourly threatened to let go and sweep
everything before it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, leaning far over the side of the
plane, was busy with his camera. He motioned
for Tim to return to the village.
There they took pictures of the practically
deserted town and Tim dropped low enough
for Ralph to get some good flashes of the
men and women working along the edge
of the ice jam.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just a year before the villagers had
helped Tim when he was on the trail of the
Sky Hawk and he felt that he owed them a
real debt.</p>

<p class='c004'>They gazed upward as the plane sped
over them but they did not recognize the
scorched, blackened plane as the <em>Good
News</em>. Tim and Ralph waved eagerly, but
there was no reply. The villagers were
weighted down with despair.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph indicated that he had used the
last of the plates in the camera and Tim
swung the <em>Good News</em> into the west. He
headed back for Atkinson at 180 miles an
hour, the motor singing as they shot
through the greying sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>The clouds were dropping on them and
by the time they were half way to Atkinson
they had a ceiling of less than six hundred
feet. Tim tried to rise above the
clouds, but they were massed solidly. He
climbed to the five thousand foot level only
to find himself lost in swirling vapor and
with the air growing colder every minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ice started to form on the wings of the
<em>Good News</em> and Tim realized the danger.
The plane was harder to handle, slower to
answer the controls.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph sensed the danger of the higher
altitude and motioned for Tim to dive, but
the flying reporter shook his head. He was
too experienced an airman for a power dive
when ice was gathering on his ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>To have nosed the ship down at 180
miles an hour might be fatal for both of
them. With the ceiling probably down to
nothing they would flash out of the clouds
at high speed with only a few hundred feet
of clearance. Normally they could get
away with it but with the wings weighted
down with ice one of them might snap off
when he pulled back on the stick. It was
too dangerous to risk. He decided to take
his time, come down gradually, and fight
the ice as best he could.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next ten minutes were an hour to
Tim as he eased the <em>Good News</em> toward the
ground. Little by little they lost altitude.
The ship was loggy now with its burden of
ice but he managed to keep it out of a dive
and they finally levelled off at two hundred
feet. Even at that low altitude the clouds
were brushing their wings but the air was
warmer and the ice gradually disappeared
from the wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a few minutes Tim had been too busy
with his own troubles to think about those
of the villagers back at Auburn, but the
danger of the ice past his mind returned to
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been plain to him that unless
something was done in the next few hours
the massed ice would give way and march
down the valley, sweeping everything before
it. As towns went Auburn wasn’t
much to brag about, but its people were
friendly and the village was home to them.
Tim, an orphan, knew what it meant to be
without a home and he resolved to do everything
within his means to help the villagers.</p>

<p class='c004'>They roared over the suburbs of Atkinson,
sped across the heart of the city, and
skidded over the ground to roll to a stop
in front of their own hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor was waiting for
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get the pictures O. K.?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Camera full of the best ice photos you
ever saw,” grinned Ralph as he eased his
cramped legs over the side of the plane and
dropped to the muddy ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is the situation in the valley?”
asked the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Critical,” replied Tim as he shut off his
engine. “I never saw so much ice in my
life. The jam is at a sharp bend in the
river just above the village. Thousands
and thousands of tons of ice has piled up
there and the river is bringing down more
every hour. The flow of water below the
jam is practically shut off and it’s spreading
out above the ice. By tomorrow morning
the whole thing will let go and that
will be the end of the village.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are the people doing?” Carl
Hunter wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything they can do,” said Ralph.
“All the men and women are out at the jam,
working side by side. I saw them plant
several charges of dynamite and they might
just as well have been five inch firecrackers
for all the good it did. There isn’t enough
dynamite in this part of the state to move
that jam. They couldn’t get it planted in
time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish we could do something to help
them,” said the managing editor thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you really want to save the village,”
said Tim, “I think I’ve got a plan that will
work. Listen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In a few words he outlined his plan. The
managing editor listened thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds like it is the only chance of saving
them, but you’ll be running a mighty
big risk, Tim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m willing to take the chance if you’ll
let me have the <em>Good News</em>. I’ll have to
cover nearly a thousand miles before I can
really start work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The <em>Good News</em> and anything else you
need is yours,” promised the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll get ready and start at once,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Count me in,” added Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not in this first trip,” said Tim. “I’ve
got to fly fast and far and the less weight
the faster I’ll go. When I’m ready to start
for Auburn again I’ll need you. In the
meantime you see that we have at least a
dozen flares ready to take with us for it will
be midnight or later by the time we reach
the valley again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph promised to have the parachute
flares ready and then followed the managing
editor to one of the <em>New’s</em> cars. An
extra was being held up for the pictures in
Ralph’s camera and after all his duty was
to the paper first.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim turned the <em>Good News</em> over to
the Mechanics for refueling and went over
to Hunter’s office to get warm and map out
the course of his next flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The field manager unfurled a roll of
maps and helped Tim check his plans.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re going to get plenty of hours in
the air today,” he grinned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it,” smiled Tim, “And only a
little more than three hours ago I was
grumbling because there wasn’t more
chance for any flying assignments this
week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim took a ruler and laid out his course,
an air line from Atkinson to Fort Armstrong,
the nearest army post. It was a
good five hundred miles and with certain
weather ahead Tim knew that he would
have to count on three hours for the flight.
He should be at the army post by seven
o’clock. If he allowed himself one hour
at the post he ought to be able to start back
around 8 o’clock. Three more hours and
he would be back in Atkinson at 11 o’clock.
A stop to pick up Ralph, make final arrangements
and then into the air again for
Cedar river valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every minute counted and after carefully
checking his course Tim hurried back
to his plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aren’t you going to telephone the Fort
you’re coming?” asked the field manager.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Carson promised to do that,” replied
Tim. “I’ll need his political pull to get
the material I need at the Fort. You phone
Carson when I take off. Have him tell the
army people I’ll drop in on them about 7
o’clock, wind and weather allowing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll make it all right, Tim,” said
Carson, “But look out for ice if you go too
high.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had a taste of that coming back from
the valley,” said the flying reporter. “No
more of that for me if I can help myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Enough gas for a four hour flight had
been placed in the tanks of the <em>Good News</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The engine, still warm, caught on the
first turn and roared into action.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim adjusted the pack parachute Carson
had brought from the office, settled himself
on his seat, and motioned “all clear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Water and mud sprayed from the wheels
as the <em>Good News</em> picked up speed. Then
it lifted off the heavy field, shook itself
free of the mud, and climbed the low-hanging
clouds.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ceiling was less than five hundred
and by this time the afternoon was grey and
a sharp breeze was zipping down out of the
north. It would be a nasty night for
flying over an unmarked and unlighted course.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim followed the air mail trail for half
an hour and then turned to his left. Fort
Armstrong was now almost straight south
on an air line. With prairie country the
flight would have been easy but Tim knew
that 200 miles out of Atkinson he would
run into the Flint hills, a branch of the
Great Smoky Mountains which wandered
out into the prairie at a most inconvenient
angle. If the ceiling was low over the
Flint hills, he would be in for a nasty half
hour of flying.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first hour slid away as Tim roared
southward at nearly 200 miles an hour.
The thunder of his motor roused prairie
villages from their winter lethargy and
stampeded cattle on lonely farms. Occasionally
some farmer, surprised at his
chores, shook his fist angrily as Tim sailed
over the chimney tops.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ceiling was still six hundred when
Tim sighted the first low ridge of hills that
marked the Flint range. He had flown
over the territory only once before and that
time when he was returning the year before
from Old Mexico with exclusive pictures
of a rebel leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hills were really ridges of rock,
rearing their sharp, bleak heads into the
air—a trap for any unwary flyer. To crash
on those inhospitable crags would have
meant the end for plane and pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim lifted the <em>Good News</em> until his wing
tips were brushing the massed clouds. Six
hundred and fifty was the highest he could
go without burying himself in the clouds
and flying blind, something which he did
not relish.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim throttled down to half speed as he
reached the first ridge of the Flint hills.
He cleared the tops of the crags by two
hundred feet and was congratulating himself
when another ridge loomed ahead of
his spinning prop. The second one bulked
higher and beyond he could see a third
which buried its head in the low-hanging
clouds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim slid over the second ridge and then
swung sharply to the right. Perhaps he
would find a gap in the third ridge which
would let him through. For five minutes
he sped along, hunting for some opening
that would let him through. He was almost
ready to make a blind attempt through
the clouds when he caught sight of a break
in the hills. It was not more than 200 feet
wide but Tim took the chance, banked the
<em>Good News</em> sharply, and dove for the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hills closed in on him and dismal
masses of rock on each side waited for him
to crash. But he slid through the narrow
break and found himself again over the
prairie, the hills in the background.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rest of the trip to Fort Armstrong
was easy going compared with the task of
getting through the hills and Tim sighted
the lights of the army post at five minutes
to seven.</p>

<p class='c004'>Markers on the landing field flashed on
when guards heard the sound of his motor
and mechanics were waiting to guide his
ship into a hangar when he landed and
taxied up the runway.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim’s body ached from the cold and his
legs were stiff and cramped. A mechanic
reached up and gave him a hand as he clambered
out of the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>An officer with a captain’s bars on his
shoulder, strode into the hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were expecting you, Murphy,” he
said. “Your managing editor telephoned
that you were on your way and we’ve tried
to have everything ready for you. How
did you find the Flint hills?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They gave me the shivers for half an
hour,” admitted Tim, “But I managed to
find a gap in the third ridge and got through
without burying myself in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were lucky,” commented the army
man who introduced himself as Captain
John Nugent, in command of the air force
at Fort Armstrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better come over to my quarters and
get warm and have a snack to eat,” suggested
the army man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim readily agreed for he was chilled
to the bone and hungry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you’re anxious to start back,”
said Captain Nugent, “But you’ll be more
alert if you rest a few minutes and fill up
with some hot food. I’ve had my boy keep
things hot for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s mighty nice of you,” said Tim,
“And I expect I’ll save time in the end if
I take a few minutes rest here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they reached the captain’s quarters,
the army man insisted that Tim take
off his things and enjoy a good meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you planned your trip back?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like I’ll have to try the Flint
hills in the dark,” said Tim. “I’ve got to
be in Atkinson before midnight if my plan
to help the people at Auburn is going to
work. I’m sure that ice jam will go before
morning and if it does it’s goodbye to
that town.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If anything goes wrong with your ship
in the hills with the load you’ll be carrying,
it will be curtains for you,” said the army
man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t had time to think about that,”
confessed Tim. “As far as I can see it is
the only way to get back in time. I’ll have
to bore up into the clouds and take a
chance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Columbus took a chance and was
lucky,” said Captain Nugent. “However,
you’re not Columbus and you’ve had just
about your share of luck for one day. Don’t
tempt fate too much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t deliberately tempt fate,” said
Tim, “But time counts tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would half an hour make a great deal
of difference?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It might,” replied the flying reporter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Half an hour isn’t long when it comes
to considering your own life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I must think of the people of Auburn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you crash in the Flint hills it won’t
help them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True enough. But what else can I
do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go around the hills.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That would take too much time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not more than an extra half hour,”
countered the army man. “Look at this
map.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They bent over the map on the table and
the army officer pointed out what he considered
Tim’s best route for the return
flight to Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have to swing to the east of the
hills,” he said, “But your flight will be
over level country and you’ll have a chance
if anything goes wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe you’re right,” agreed Tim.
“The last thing I’m looking for tonight is
a crack-up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An orderly came in to announce that
Tim’s plane was ready for the return trip.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Nugent put on a heavy coat and
accompanied Tim to the runway. The
<em>Good News</em>, outlined in the field’s floodlights, was waiting for Tim, motor idling.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Nugent climbed up to the forward
cockpit and made a thorough inspection
of the contents. Satisfied that
everything was ship-shape, he dropped
back to the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got an even dozen demolition
bombs,” he told Tim. “The men didn’t
have time to rig a bomb rack on your plane
but they did the next best thing. They
put the 'eggs’ in a hammock that will carry
them without danger unless you happen to
crack-up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pleasant prospect,” smiled Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I don’t think you’ll have any
trouble if you swing out around the Flint
hills,” said the army officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say, what the dickens have you been
doing to this plane?” he demanded as he
noticed for the first time, the smoke-blackened
condition of the wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim explained what had taken place
earlier in the day and the army officer
whistled as the flying reporter told how
they had been caught by the explosion of
the oil tanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you’ve had a narrow escape like that
today,” said Captain Nugent, “I guess flying
the hills at night won’t bother you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve decided not to risk it,” said Tim.
“I’m going to go around.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The air is getting sharper,” said the
army man. “Sure you’ve got warm enough
clothes? We’ll be glad to lend you some
extra togs if there is anything you need.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks a lot,” said Tim. “You’ve
been mighty good to let me have these high
explosive bombs. I won’t need anything
more and now I think I’d better get under
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim climbed into the rear cockpit, tested
the motor, and after waving farewell to
Captain Nugent, sent the <em>Good News</em> skimming
down the lighted runway.</p>

<p class='c004'>The motor barked lustily as the plane
gained altitude, the lights of the Fort Armstrong
were soon lost in the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim followed the course Captain Nugent
had helped him lay out. For more
than an hour he sped over the right-of-way
of the Southwestern Railroad. Mile after
mile he was guided by the dim streaks of
steel which were barely discernible in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The railroad skimmed the east end of
the Flint hills and when the lights of
Macon showed in the distance Tim knew
he was around the worst barrier. The
dreaded hills now lay to his left and behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced at his watch. He was making
good time. With no unforeseen emergencies
he would be in Atkinson by eleven.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky had lightened somewhat and
Tim now had a ceiling of 1,000 feet. With
a greater margin of safety, he opened the
throttle wide and the <em>Good News</em> bored
into the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the dim light of the instrument board
Tim could see the needle on the air speed
indicator hovering near the 200-mile an
hour mark. He was making more than
three miles a minute. That was time! It
was faster than Tim had ever traveled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the indicator crept on up. Two
hundred and five and then it wavered at two
hundred and ten. The motor was not turning
over any faster than a minute or two
before so Tim knew he must have picked
up a good tail wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let’er go! The sooner he reached Atkinson
the sooner he would be on the last
lap of his trip to Auburn and the nearer
the completion of his plans for the salvation
of the village. On he roared through
the night and the lights of small towns were
little more than blurs in a magic carpet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Far ahead the lights of Atkinson reflected
against the clouds and four minutes
later Tim was throttling down the motor
preparatory to gliding into the airport.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time since leaving Fort
Armstrong the load of high explosive
bombs which he had obtained at the army
post worried him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Supposing he struck a mud puddle and
nosed over? One blinding, shattering blast
and it would be all over. So much depended
on the success of his landing that
he dared not think of failure.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flood lights came on and bathed the
field in a chilling blue brilliance. Tim cut
his motor and sidled down, killing speed
every second. He glanced at his watch.
Ten fifty-five; five minutes to the good.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was less than two hundred feet above
the field when the deafening roar of an
incoming tri-motored passenger and express
plane drowned the sound of his own
motor. Tim looked up and froze at his
controls. The tri-motor was coming in
from the left, and their paths would cross
in less than 300 feet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tim could see lights gleaming from the
windows of the tri-motor. It was the westbound
transcontinental more than an hour
late and its pilots were bringing it in fast
in an attempt to make up every minute possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>The distance between the planes narrowed
rapidly. The <em>Good News</em> had almost
lost flying speed, was drifting in,
when Tim first sighted the tri-motor and
he was powerless to change his course.</p>

<p class='c004'>He jammed the throttle open and the
motor coughed as the raw fuel leaped into
the white-hot cylinders. There was only
one chance; that he could get up enough
speed to throw the <em>Good News</em> into a nose
dive. He could avoid the tri-motor that
way but his own chances of coming out of
the dive would be slim.</p>

<p class='c004'>In that split second Tim made his decision.
He would attempt the dive. There
were probably women and children on the
tri-motor for the night plane usually carried
a heavy passenger list. If the two
planes met they would all be blown to
eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> picked up momentum
again and Tim shoved the nose down. Just
as he pushed the stick ahead he heard the
engines of the tri-motor quicken their
stride. Evidently the pilots of the big ship
had seen him and were making a desperate
effort to avert the collision. Tim hoped
they would have enough sense to climb.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> quivered under the sudden
strain of the maneuver and Tim saw the
ground race up to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The undercarriage of the tri-motor almost
brushed the upper wing of the <em>Good
News</em>. Then the planes were clear but the
<em>Good News</em> was diving toward the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim had only one hope. He pulled back
on the stick and closed his eyes. He could
feel the ship falling, then the pitch of the
descent lessened. He opened his eyes. The
<em>Good News</em> was skimming along the field
with its wheels less than five feet from the
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim looked up for the tri-motor. It was
circling, waiting for him to land.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter lifted the <em>Good
News</em> up again for he was going too fast to
attempt a landing. He swung around and
then dropped down on the field, checking
his speed with a delicate hand lest he bump
hard enough to set off the “eggs” cradled
in the forward cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> rolled to a stop in front
of its hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carson, Hunter, Ralph and a group of
mechanics were waiting for Tim. They
were white and shaky for they had seen
how death had ridden on the wings of the
two incoming planes only a minute before.
“Tim, Tim,” cried Ralph in a choked
voice, “I thought you were a goner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So did I,” admitted Tim, and for once
he found it hard to smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll report those flying yahoos,” stormed
the usually mild-mannered Hunter.
“They’ll be grounded for thirty days for
pulling a reckless landing like that. You
had the right of way and they attempted
to cut in on you. Here they come now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The tri-motor had come to a stop on the
concrete apron in front of the administration
building and its pilots sprinted toward
the No. 5 hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were red-faced and shaking with
anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the idea?” stormed the first one
as he addressed Tim. “You crazy, flying
fool, you almost wrecked us. I’ve a good
notion to beat up on you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shut up!” The words whipped through
the night and the angry pilot turned to face
the field manager.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But this nut almost wrecked us,” he
protested as he pointed at Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shut up!” cried Hunter and he almost
choked with rage, “if anybody here is going
to get a licking you’re one of them. You
cut in on Murphy. We had given him the
right-of-way and you barged down and almost
ran him into the ground. As it happens
he was on special duty tonight, flying
in here from Fort Armstrong. You may
have something to explain to Uncle Sam
and the least you’ll hear about this will be
thirty days on the ground without pay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can’t get away with that,” protested
the second flyer. “Why this kid was
trying to beat us in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll get away with it and I may have
your skins to boot,” promised Carson.
“You’re so all-fired smart, suppose you step
over here and take a look at the load
Murphy is carrying tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilots of the big transport followed
Hunter to the <em>Good News</em> where they
peered into the forward cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bombs!” exclaimed one.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d have been blown to pieces if we
had met in the air,” gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which is just exactly the reason Murphy
took such a desperate chance to avoid
hitting you,” exclaimed Hunter. “Do you
still want to beat up on him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not on your life,” said the transport
pilots and they turned to Tim to offer their
apologies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are lucky to be here,” said Tim as
the tri-motor men stammered their appreciation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, who had gained control of his
emotions, busied himself loading a dozen
parachute flares into the forward cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>By 11:15 the <em>Good News</em> had been refueled
for the flight to Auburn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are the latest reports?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The ice is piling up every hour,” said
the managing editor. “People in the village
have started to move their belongings
and they expect the town will be swept
away before morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have they been warned to watch for
us and get in the clear when we start dropping
the bombs?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everyone has been ordered to be in the
clear by midnight. Before they leave they
will build large fires along the bank of the
river to guide you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a good idea,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All set,” he called to Ralph, who had
taken his place in the forward cockpit,
squeezed in between high explosive bombs
and parachute flares.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All ready,” replied Ralph. “Only take
it easy. I don’t want to be part of another
explosion today.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry,” said Tim. “I’ll handle
the ship like we were carrying a basket of
Easter eggs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim settled himself for the flight to
Auburn and a minute later the <em>Good News</em>
was winging its way into the east.</p>

<p class='c004'>The safety of the village depended on
the success of their efforts. Within the next
hour and Tim and Ralph realized the seriousness
of their mission.</p>

<p class='c004'>They sped into the night at a chilling
pace and both reporters welcomed the signal
fires which marked the course of the
river. It was just before midnight when
they swung down out of the sky to reconnoiter
the ice jam.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph dropped a parachute flare which
lighted the country-side for half a mile
around.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no one in the vicinity of the
jam and the village had been deserted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim inspected the face of the jam
closely, hunting for the key point where
the pressure was greatest. Up and down
the river they cruised while Ralph lighted
three more flares.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally Tim was satisfied that he had
picked out the vulnerable spots in the jam
and he motioned for Ralph to get ready
with the bombs.</p>

<p class='c004'>By pre-arranged signal Ralph was to
drop a bomb over board every time Tim
raised his left arm. Several of the flares
had dropped on the ice and there was plenty
of light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim’s arm jerked upward and a small,
black object hurtled down from the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The night was torn by a blinding flash
followed by an ear-shattering roar. A
geyser of ice and water mounted upward
from the point where the bomb had struck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Score one,” cried Ralph as he prepared
another bomb.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim nodded grimly. The explosion had
been spectacular but he wondered how
much it had weakened the jam.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph dropped two more parachute
flares and before their light had faded they
had time to plant four bombs. More flares
and more bombs. They honeycombed the
face of the jam with the high-explosive
missiles and above the sound of their own
plane they could hear the angry grumble of
the river as the restless water, impounded
by the ice barrier, sought to continue its
journey down stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had one flare and two bombs left
and they had failed to break the jam.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim motioned for Ralph to light one of
the two remaining flares and in the calcium
glare he made a final survey of the river.
His arm moved quickly and Ralph tossed
out the last of the bombs.</p>

<p class='c004'>They watched the little black objects
speed toward the ice; then saw them swallowed
in mounting sprays of ice and water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim could hear Ralph’s shout of victory
above the sound of their own motor
and the rumble of the river as the waters,
the ice barrier finally broken, started down
stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>The river was a heaving, moving mass of
ice. Great cakes leaped high into the air
and came down with thundering crashes
as the pressure of the water was unleashed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim watched the breaking of the jam
with apprehension. There was just a
chance that the river might rush over its
banks and sweep away the village but if he
had calculated right the force of the onrushing
water would be expended on the
far side of the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light from the fires on the edge of
the river reflected dully on the scene and
was not sufficient to show them what was
taking place. After five minutes of anxious
cruising, Tim yelled to Ralph to light
the last of their flares.</p>

<p class='c004'>The brilliant white light revealed a
scene majestic in its power yet terrible in
its uncontrolled fury.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thousands of tons of ice were moving
down stream, sweeping everything before
them but they were moving in the direction
Tim had planned. The ice was piling
over the banks of the river, leveling great
trees, crushing the few barns and small
buildings on the far side of the river, but
the village itself was safe and already the
villagers were starting to return to their
homes.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dozen men who had come down to the
river bank to watch the ice go out waved
their thanks at the flying reporters.</p>

<p class='c004'>With his goal reached and success at
hand, Tim felt a great drowziness creep
over him. His hand lost its firm grip on
the stick and his eyes closed in spite of
himself. He managed to shake off the fatigue
and shouted to Ralph to take the
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph fitted the extra stick in the control
socket in the forward cockpit and
waggled the controls, indicating that he
was ready.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> turned away from Auburn,
away from the tumbling mass of ice
in the Cedar River, and sped toward home.
Tim, exhausted by the strenuous experiences
of the day, dropped into a deep
slumber and did not awaken until Ralph
plopped into a mud puddle on their home
field.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The story of the flying reporters and their
successful effort to break the ice jam which
threatened Auburn was the front page news
the next day. Tim and Ralph collaborated
in writing the story of their night flights
and the managing editor wrote a front page
editorial praising them for their heroism
and devotion to duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>A telegram from the mayor of Auburn,
in which he expressed the appreciation and
gratefulness of the residents of the village,
was also printed in a box on the front page.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dan Watkins, the veteran chief of the
copy desk, smiled at Tim when the first
edition came off the press.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like you and Ralph have just
about monopolized the front page,” said
the gray-haired copyreader.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d just as soon not be there,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know, I know,” said Watkins, “but
it is all fine advertising for the <em>News</em>.
Wonder if you chaps will get a raise or a
bonus.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wasn’t looking for either one when
I decided to make the attempt,” said Tim.
“I only thought of those poor folks in the
valley who were faced with the loss of
their homes if the jam broke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you weren’t looking for personal
gain or glory,” replied the copyreader,
who had long been a friend and
valued adviser of Tim’s. “You do what
you think is right; that’s one reason why
you are invaluable to the <em>News</em>. Last night
the managing editor paced the floor every
minute you were in the air. Keep at it,
Tim, and one of these days you’ll be the
managing editor of some large paper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After the noon edition was on the press
the managing editor summoned Tim and
Ralph to his desk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What about the condition of the <em>Good
News</em>?” he asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have to pay for a complete repaint
job, Mr. Carson,” said Tim. “The
ship was badly scorched and smoked up
when we got caught in the explosion over
the flaming oil tanks. It ought to have the
rigging thoroughly checked to see that
nothing was sprung in the hard flying I did
the rest of the day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, Tim,” said the managing
editor. “You and Ralph take the afternoon
off, go out to the field, and get a crew
started on the repainting. Never can tell
when we’ll need the plane in another emergency
and it has become invaluable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then the stories we’ve uncovered in the
last year have justified the expense of the
plane?” Tim asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No question about it,” replied the
managing editor. “You have done far
more than either the business manager or I
expected and your aviation column is one
of our best news features. The only thing
I worry about is that you boys will crash
one of these days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t worry about that,” put in Ralph.
“There is little danger for we have a good
ship and we try not to take unnecessary
chances.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph went to the administration
building when they reached the airport.
They found Carl Hunter in his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello, heroes,” he called, whereupon
Tim and Ralph gave him a good-natured
pummeling that left them all breathless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now that the cyclone is over,” smiled
the field manager, “I suppose you want
something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re right for once,” said Tim. “We
want you to put a crew on repainting the
<em>Good News</em> and checking up on the rigging.
Carson said to get it done in a hurry
for we may need the ship at any time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had a hunch you’d breeze in sometime
today with a request like that,” replied the
field manager, “and I’m one up on you.
A couple of painters are waiting in the
hangar now. Same color job as before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same,” said Tim, “and I hope this
one will last longer than the one we
scorched off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may not be so lucky the next time
you start flirting with burning tanks of
oil,” warned Hunter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There won’t be any next time,” promised
Ralph. “We’ve had our fill of those
thrills. No more dodging a chunk of steel
that’s intent on destroying us. Honestly,
I lived a whole lifetime in that split second.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter and the young reporters left the
administration building and walked to hangar
No. 5. The scorched and blackened
plane that reposed inside was hardly recognizable
as the <em>Good News</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter gave his instructions to the
painters and they started cleaning the wings
and fuselage preparatory to repainting the
plane. Several mechanics were summoned
and they set about the task of making a
thorough check of the motor and the rigging
of the <em>Good News</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they left the hangar and started
back for their car, a raw, wet wind cut
through their clothes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Feels like another blizzard is getting
ready to descend on us,” remarked Ralph
as he scanned the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Weather report says 'continued
cloudy’,” replied the field manager, “and
I’m hoping it’s right. Another blizzard
would raise havoc with us. Everyone of
our planes is carrying its capacity of mail
and we’re making every possible effort to
keep on schedule.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ralph is inclined to be pessimistic today,”
laughed Tim. “He’s always predicting
a blizzard or cloudburst.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A clerk ran out of the administration
building and called to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re wanted on the telephone,” he
told Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter hurried to answer
the summons. When he rejoined Ralph
several minutes later his face was grave.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something’s in the wind,” he said.
“Carson just phoned from the office and
wants us to go to town as fast as we can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have any idea what he wants?” asked
Ralph as they climbed into the roadster
which had brought them to the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a glimmer,” replied Tim. “There
is something mighty mysterious. He talked
so low I could hardly hear what he said.
We’re not to go to the office. Carson will
meet us in room 309 at the Hotel Jefferson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds like secret service,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That might not be so far wrong,” replied
Tim thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fifteen minutes later the reporters entered
the Hotel Jefferson and made their
way to the third floor. They stopped at
the door of room 309 and Tim knocked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door was opened by the managing
editor of the <em>News</em>, who motioned for them
to enter the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were two men beside the managing
editor in the room when Tim and
Ralph entered. They were strangers to
the reporters and they waited for Carson
to introduce them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When I introduce these men,” Carson
told his reporters, “You’ll know why I had
you come to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor turned to the older
of the strangers, a heavy-set, gray-haired
man whose eyes were of an unusual, penetrating
blue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boys,” he said, “I want you to know
Col. Robert Searle, head of the state police
department.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph felt their pulses quicken
as they heard the name of the visitor. The
managing editor turned to introduce the
second man, who was taller than Searle and
younger by several years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I also want you to know,” went
on the managing editor, “Captain Ned
Raymond of the bureau of investigation
of the state police.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph acknowledged the introductions
and sat down on the bed. They
waited for the managing editor to continue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“These men have called on us for assistance,”
explained Carson. “I want them
to tell you their troubles and the final decision
on what you do will be up to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Searle moved restlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve heard a great deal about you boys,”
he said “especially in connection with the
Sky Hawk. You did great work there but
I thought you were older.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“An older man wouldn’t be as fast, as
alert, as Tim and Ralph,” said their managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps you’re right,” agreed Colonel
Searle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Captain Raymond and I are playing
a hunch,” he went on, “and we have both
agreed that if this hunch comes true we
are going to need your aid. The airplane
has placed an entirely new means of escape
in the hands of criminals and we must be
ready to combat this. With the present
economy policy of the state legislature it
would be impossible for us to secure funds
for the training of our troopers as pilots or
for the purchase of an airplane. For that
reason we came here today to appeal to
your managing editor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The head of the state police paused for
a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Interested?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go on,” chorused Tim and Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What we have in mind,” continued
Colonel Searle, “is deputising you two for
special service. If any emergency arises
in which we need an airplane in this section
of the state, you would be available.
It would also insure your paper of being in
first on big news stories.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If Mr. Carson is favorable,” said Tim,
“you can count on Ralph and me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just a minute,” put in Captain Raymond.
“One thing more. There has been
a change in the political set-up in Dearborn
and as a result many criminals are going
to be driven out of that city and forced to
other fields. It will be natural for some of
them to transfer their activities to this state.
If they come, as we confidently expect, they
will be more dangerous than the average
bandit. And remember, the Sky Hawk
is gone but some of his men are still alive.
Through special police channels we have
learned that several of them have banded
together again and have been operating in
and near Dearborn. If they decide to come
back this way your mission might be doubly
dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They couldn’t be any worse than the
Sky Hawk,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that case,” said Colonel Searle, “I
consider it an honor and a privilege to
appoint you as special and secret members of
the state police.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond produced the records
which Tim and Ralph were to sign and in
less than five minutes they were in the state
police.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Searle gave them identification
cards and the small gold eagle which also
indicated their position.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We may not need you,” said Captain
Raymond, “but if things come out as I
predict, it won’t be long before part of the
Sky Hawk’s old gang will be back. The
Hawk is gone, thanks to you boys, but the
memory of his methods and daring lives
on in the minds of the men who associated
with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As the newspaper men prepared to leave,
Colonel Searle added a final word of caution.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember, not a word about our meeting
here to anyone. If it becomes known
in any way, that we have enlisted you as
special agents, it might expose you to needless
danger. That’s why we had you meet
us here instead of in your office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph were the first to leave
room 309. In spite of their excitement
they did not speak until they were back
in their car where their conversation could
not be overheard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think of it?” asked
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like the state police are expecting
serious trouble and are getting ready
for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean the Sky Hawk’s old gang?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought they were through when we
got the Sky Hawk,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had hoped so,” said Tim, “but I guess
it was too good to be true. If they do
come this way, they won’t have any love
for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph looked down at the little gold
eagle in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At least we’ll have the power of the
state police behind us,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And we’ll probably need it,” added
Tim.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tim and Ralph returned to the <em>News</em> office
where Tim busied himself writing copy
for his aviation column in the next day’s
paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the letters he found on his desk
was one from the news director of the
Transcontinental Air Mail Company at
San Francisco. The letter contained an
announcement of the company plans to increase
their passenger and air mail service
to three trips a day each way across country.
It would mean the inauguration of the most
auspicious air transport program in the
country.</p>

<p class='c004'>The letter went on to say that giant tri-motored
biplanes, capable of carrying 18
passengers and half a ton of mail or express,
were being completed in the Transcontinental’s
shops. A half dozen of the
new planes would be put in service with the
opening of the new schedule and a dozen
more would be completed as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>The letter indicated that all of the planes
would stop at Atkinson, which meant Tim’s
home city would have the best transcontinental
air service in the country. The
story was news, big news, and he devoted
the remainder of the afternoon to writing
it. He got in touch with Carl Hunter at
the field and learned that Hunter had just
received instructions to put on an extra
ground crew. The postmaster supplied information
on the value of the increased air
mail service to bankers and business men
and when Tim had finished gathering his
material he had enough for a two column
story.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young aviation editor of the <em>News</em>
worked until six o’clock, went out for a
hasty dinner, and returned to the office to
complete his story. The aviation copy must
be ready the first thing in the morning to
send to the waiting Linotypes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim checked the facts in his story carefully.
When he finished reading it over he
felt that it was a creditable news story,
certainly it was interesting and he thought
it fairly well written.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, who had been sent out late in the
afternoon to cover a service club dinner,
came stamping into the office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of all the hot air,” he exploded, “I’ve
listened to a prize assortment in the last
hour and a half. I’m always getting stuck
for some assignment like this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim had little sympathy to offer and
Ralph went over to his typewriter and
banged savagely at the keys.</p>

<p class='c004'>At nine o’clock the boys decided to call
it a day. Tim had written the last line of
copy for his aviation department and Ralph
had managed to finish his story on the dinner.</p>

<p class='c004'>The air was raw and bitter when they
reached the street and heavy clouds obscured
the stars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nasty night for the air mail,” commented
Tim as he turned up the collar of
his coat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going to snow before morning,” predicted
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hope you’re wrong,” replied Tim.
“We’ve had enough winter. I’m ready for
spring.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young reporters walked to the corner
where they boarded different street
cars. Ralph started home and Tim went
to his room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim undressed when he reached his
room, selected an interesting adventure
novel, and stretched out on his bed to read.
Lost in the thrilling exploits of the hero
of the novel, he did not notice the passage
of time. The coolness of the room finally
aroused him and when he looked at the
clock it was nearly midnight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim got up and felt the radiator. It was
cold and the wind was whistling in the
eaves outside his window. He looked down
into the street. Faint swirls of snow
danced along the paving and while he
watched the air became thick with snowflakes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind was increasing, whipping the
snow into a blizzard. Tim could hardly
see beyond the first street light. He looked
at the clock again. It would be tough on
the air mail flyers if they were between
landing fields or in the Great Smokies when
the storm broke. The rugged peaks of the
mountains would be merciless on such a
night.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim turned to the telephone and called
the municipal airport. After an interval
Carl Hunter answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is the mail?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Getting a bad break,” snapped Hunter.
“The storm dropped like a blanket and two
of the ships were caught in the Great
Smokies. We haven’t heard from either
the eastbound or the westbound for more
than half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing until the storm breaks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send out rescue planes if I can find anyone
to fly them. All of the mail pilots are
on the east end of the division and even if
the storm lets up at daybreak it will be
noon before they can get here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can count Ralph and me for anything
we can do,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks a lot,” replied the field manager.
“I’d appreciate it if you would come
out now. I’m here all alone and my nerves
are getting jumpy in the storm. Bring
plenty of heavy clothes for the temperature
is dropping fast. May be near zero by
morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim promised to go to the field at once
and after Hunter had hung up the receiver
telephoned for Ralph. A sleepy-sounding
voice finally answered his summons and in
a few words Tim explained what was
needed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll throw on some clothes and hop a
cab for the field,” said Ralph, all thought
of sleep having vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim dressed carefully and warmly for
he had a hunch it would be a good many
hours before he saw bed again and from
past experiences he was wise enough to follow
his hunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter phoned for a cab
and then went downstairs to await its arrival.
He stopped at the door of his landlady’s
room and slipped a note under to
tell of his sudden departure. Then he went
into the front hallway. The lights of a
cab gleamed dimly through the snow and
Tim hastened out into the storm.</p>

<p class='c004'>The taxi driver, heavily bundled,
grunted as Tim gave his destination.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure you want to get to the airport?”
demanded the driver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you make it?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know,” replied the taxi man.
“The snow is drifting fast and that road
is bad on a night like this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“See how far you can get,” said Tim
as he climbed into the cab.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a grinding of gears the cab
moved into the storm. The snow was
falling in a solid blanket that obscured even
the buildings flanking the street. Lights
were visible for only a few feet and Tim
and the driver felt as though they were
in a world of their own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once or twice the cab slid into the curb
but each time the driver managed to keep
it under way and they finally pulled
through the gate at the airport. Tim told
the driver to charge the trip to the <em>News</em>
and was about to enter the administration
building when another cab jolted to a stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, bundled in a heavy coat, hopped
out and followed Tim into the field
manager’s office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter, a radiophone headset at his ears,
was listening intently to an air mail report.
He motioned for the boys to take chairs
and went on with his work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporters waited until Hunter had
finished taking the message.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What news now?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bad news,” replied the field manager.
“Two planes lost somewhere in the Great
Smokies. It’s a cinch that the storm
forced them down and you know how much
chance there is of making a safe set-down
on a night like this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who were on the ships?” Ralph
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tiny Lewis was coming east and
George Mitchell	was on the westbound,”
replied Hunter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They don’t make any better flyers than
those two,” commented Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But they can’t buck a storm like this,”
Hunter reminded. “Why, man alive, you
can’t see ten feet ahead of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe they had a break and landed
when the first flakes started down,” suggested
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re too optimistic,” replied the field
manager. “This storm wasn’t on the
weather charts. It just dropped down from
nowhere. I don’t believe those ships could
have stayed up two minutes after they
nosed into the storm and neither one of
the pilots had time to use their radio-phones.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing they had parachutes,” said
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid chutes wouldn’t do them
much good,” said Tim. “They wouldn’t
have time to use them and wouldn’t know
where they were going if they did. We’ll
find Lewis and Mitchell with the planes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Conversation stopped. There was no
use to say anything more. They knew the
air mail pilots had stuck by their ships.
When the storm cleared they would find
the ships and the pilots and they only
hoped that in some miraculous fashion the
ships had not crashed too hard.</p>

<p class='c004'>At four o’clock the storm lessened and
the wind abated. At five o’clock there
was only a trace of snow in the air and at
six o’clock the mechanics had struggled
through the drifts from town and were
warming up two reserve mail planes. The
<em>Good News</em>, its fuselage damp from the
coat of paint, was in no condition to take the
air and Hunter had placed two of the
Transcontinental’s planes at the disposal
of the flying reporters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph loaded thermos bottles
of hot chocolate into the cockpits of their
planes, put in first aid kits, ropes and hand
axes and generally prepared for any emergency
that might confront them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abundant supplies of extra blankets
were tossed into the mail compartment
ahead of the pilot’s cockpit and the hood
was strapped down.</p>

<p class='c004'>The motors of the great green and silver
biplanes droned steadily as Tim and Ralph
seated themselves at the controls.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Locate them first,” Hunter shouted to
the reporters. “If you can’t land and bring
them out yourselves, come back and get
help. Good luck and—hurry!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph fully understood the
urgency of their mission and they swung
the tails of their planes around, opened the
throttles and bounced over the field in a
smother of snow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail planes, their 525 horsepower
motors barking in the near zero weather,
lifted off the field and sailed away toward
the Great Smokies. Somewhere hidden in
the dim peaks to the west were the air mail
planes and their pilots.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The heavy mail plane was much different
from the <em>Good News</em> and Tim spent the
first five minutes in the air getting used to
the controls and the feel of the ship. The
air speed indicator showed one hundred ten
miles an hour with a quartering wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky was clear and the cold air made
him thankful for the heavy flying clothes
he had donned before climbing into the
ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporters had mapped out
their plan of action before leaving the field
at Atkinson. Tim was to search for Lewis
while Ralph would hunt for Mitchell.
Lewis, on the eastbound plane, would have
been the farthest from the Atkinson field,
and Tim gunned his ship hard as he headed
for the mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frosty peaks of the Great Smokies
loomed ahead of the churning propeller,
ready to snag any unfortunate plane and
pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim adjusted his headset and tuned the
radiophone in on the station at Atkinson.
Hunter was talking with the air mail station
west of the mountains when Tim
broke in with his buzzer signal.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any news?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a word,” replied the field manager.
“Looks like whatever rescuing is
done today will have to be handled by you
and Ralph. We won’t have extra ships and
pilots here until nightfall and that will be
too late. You’ll have to find Lewis and
Mitchell today.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll find them if it is humanly possible,”
promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were well into the foothills of the
mountains when Ralph signaled that he
was going to start his search for Mitchell,
who had been on the westbound ship the
night before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph circled downward while Tim
continued his dash toward the formidable,
rocky crests in the west.</p>

<p class='c004'>According to all the information available,
Lewis should have been on the east
side of the divide. Five minutes before
the blizzard struck he had radiophoned
that he was about to cross the crest of the
range.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim had been up an hour and a half
when he reached the higher slopes and precipices
of the mountains. He shoved the
mail plane up and up until he was almost
to the divide before he started his detailed
search for the missing plane and pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Back and forth Tim cruised the mail
plane, dodging in and out of canyons, circling
over sheer precipices that fell away
for a thousand feet, scanning the snow and
the rocks for some sign.</p>

<p class='c004'>The powerful motor was using great
quantities of fuel and Tim watched the
gasoline gauge with an anxious eye. At
nine o’clock he had fuel for a little more
than another hour of flying. To have gone
back to Atkinson was out of the question.
He would land at some village or ranch in
the foothills, replenish his gasoline tanks,
and resume the search.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later he switched on the
radiophone and informed the field manager
that he was temporarily abandoning
his search. Hunter directed Tim to the
nearest ranch where fuel would be available
and the flying reporter snapped off the
radiophone and glided down off the divide.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten minutes later he swung low over
ranch buildings which nestled in a
sheltered valley in the foothills. Below the
buildings was a level meadow, the only
piece of ground that appeared safe to attempt
a landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The noise of the airplane motor brought
men from the ranch buildings and Tim
waved at them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Smoke coming from a chimney of the
ranch house gave him his wind direction
and he dropped down on the meadow to
make a careful survey. The field, although
covered by six or seven inches of
snow, appeared level.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim gunned the motor, banked sharply,
and fishtailed down. The mail plane
landed hard, bounced on a low ridge,
threatened to dig its nose into a drift, and
finally straightened out, coming to a standstill
not more than ten feet from a barbed
wire fence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter unfastened his
safety belt and stood up in the cockpit. His
legs ached with the cold, which had crept
through his heavy boots and clothing to
chill the very marrow of his bones.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half a dozen cowboys plowed through
the drifted snow. They greeted Tim with
cheery cries.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re off the trail, Big Boy,” said the
first cowboy to reach the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m all right,” replied Tim, “But I’ve
been out all morning looking for one of
the air mail ships that was lost in the blizzard
last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Someone get caught in the mountains?”
another cowboy asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two planes,” replied Tim. “One of
them was the westbound ship and the other
was eastbound. They were last heard
from just before the blizzard closed down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gosh,” said the first cowboy, “The
Great Smokies are a tough bunch of hills
for anyone to be caught in a storm.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve got two planes out searching for
them,” explained Tim. “I ran low on gas
and thought maybe you fellows would have
some at the ranch you could spare. It
would save me a long trip back to Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A heavy-set, red-faced man had made
his way to the green and silver mail plane.
He had overheard Tim’s request and
stepped up to the plane to introduce himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m Hank Cummins, owner of the
Circle Four Ranch,” he said. “You’re
welcome to all the gasoline you need and
anything else we can do to help you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim introduced himself and found that
the owner of the Circle Four and all of his
men had read of his exploits as the flying
reporter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re one of the fellows who got the
Sky Hawk last year!” exclaimed a cowboy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim grinned and nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>The owner of the ranch started giving
orders and the cowboys hurried away to
fill cans with gasoline and replenish the
nearly empty fuel tanks of the mail plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim crawled stiffly from the cockpit. It
felt good to be on the ground again with
a chance to exercise his stiffened muscles.
He flailed his arms to bring back the circulation
and stamped his feet on the ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>In five minutes the cowboys were back
with the heavy cans of gasoline and Tim
directed their efforts. A short time later
and the mail plane was ready to go again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better come up to the house and have
a snack to eat before you start,” urged Mr.
Cummins.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t any time to spare,” replied
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be time saved,” said the ranch
owner. “You get some warm food inside
and you’ll be a lot more alert. Come on up
to the house and sit down at the table for
a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim finally agreed and accompanied the
rancher to the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>A Chinese cook served hot coffee, bacon
and eggs and the food gave Tim new courage
and enthusiasm to resume his gruelling
search.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the flying reporter returned to the
meadow he found that the cowboys had appointed
themselves a ground crew and had
turned the mail plane around. Several of
them, armed with shovels, were busy clearing
a path through a heavy drift that extended
across the middle of the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim thanked Mr. Cummins for his
kindness and promised to send a check to
cover the bill for the gasoline.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s all right,” laughed the rancher.
“We’re glad to be able to help you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter climbed into the
cockpit, switched on the starter, and heard
the motor roar on the second or third time
over.</p>

<p class='c004'>The propeller spewed fine snow in every
direction and the cowboys ran for shelter
before the driving white particles.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim throttled down, aimed his plane
down the makeshift runway, and gave her
the gun.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail ship bounced over the frozen
surface of the meadow, swung dangerously
as the wheels bit into the soft snow which
the cowboys had attempted to clear away,
and finally nosed into the air. Tim took
his time in gaining altitude and then swung
back over the ranch. He waved at the
group below and could see them reply.
Then he headed into the west to resume his
search on the treacherous slopes of the
Great Smokies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Noon found Tim deep in the fastnesses
of the mountains, searching obscure pockets
and canyons, then roaring along thinly forested
slopes where a motor failure would
have spelled instant destruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>One o’clock.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still there was no trace of the missing
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun had cleared away the clouds of
the morning and the visibility was good.
The air was a little warmer but Tim was
forced to beat his arms against his body
to keep them from stiffening in the cold.</p>

<p class='c004'>The supply of gasoline he had obtained
at the ranch was getting low when he knew
that he was near the end of the search.
There was just enough to explore a distant
tier of peaks that swung off to his
right. Not much chance of the mail being
that far off the regular airway but he
didn’t dare let any possibility escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim scanned the broken walls of rock
ahead. There seemed little chance that a
pilot could escape if his plane crashed in
such a country.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter was about to abandon
his search when something on the
crest of a jagged ridge drew his attention.
He swung the mail ship nearer and circled
down for a closer view. It looked—it
looked—yes, it was, the tail of an air mail
plane sticking up above the rocks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim stood up in the cockpit and cried
aloud. He had found the eastbound mail!</p>

<p class='c004'>Was there a chance that the pilot had
survived the crash? The question raced
through Tim’s mind and he sent the air
mail plane hurtling downward.</p>

<p class='c004'>He levelled off two feet above the peak
which had impaled the eastbound mail
and circled carefully. He made two complete
swings and there was no sign of life
in the wrecked plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lewis, pilot of the eastbound, must have
been flying blind, attempting to make a
landing, when he struck the crag. The
mail had evidently hit the peak at a sharp
downward angle. The tail had been ripped
off and left to serve as a solitary beacon
which eventually brought Tim to the scene.
The rest of the plane had skidded and
bounced along the far slope of the mountain
for more than a hundred feet, finally
coming to rest in a small clump of straggling
mountain pine. The tough tree
trunks had crumpled the wings back along
the fuselage and Tim had to admit that it
was just about as complete a washout as he
had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no ledge along the mountain
on which he could make a landing and he
had about decided to return to Atkinson
and report when a slight movement in the
wreckage attracted his attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim dropped the heavy mail plane as
low as he dared and cut his motor down to
a minimum. He was not more than fifty
feet above the clump of pines which held
the wreck of the air mail. From the
splintered wood and canvas he saw an arm
emerge and then the face of Tiny Lewis,
one of the best pilots in the service.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter was low enough to
glimpse the wild stare in Lewis’s eyes and
he knew that the pilot had been knocked
out of his senses by the crash. While Tim
watched Lewis collapsed and sank back into
the wreckage. The motor of Tim’s ship
had aroused some inner sense and Lewis
had made a supreme effort to make his
presence known.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim looked about eagerly for a landing
field. The nearest level ground was at
least three miles down the mountain and on
the other side. There was only one thing
to do—speed for help. The Circle Four
Ranch was nearest and Tim opened the
throttle of the mail ship and sped into the
east.</p>

<p class='c004'>He wondered how Lewis had managed
to withstand the cold of the night and day.
Perhaps he had been sheltered somewhat
by the wreckage of the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was just after three o’clock when
Tim roared over the Circle Four ranch
house and set the mail plane down in the
pasture with little ceremony. By the time
he had taxied back to the side of the field
nearest the ranch buildings Cummins and
his cowboys were climbing the fence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve found the eastbound plane and
pilot,” shouted Tim, “and I need more gas
and a couple of men to fly back with me
and help get the pilot out. He appears
hurt and is caught in the wreckage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hank Cummins roared orders with great
gusto and the cowboys hurried to carry
them out. The fuel tanks were refilled in
record time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You say you needed two men?” asked
the owner of the Circle Four.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be a long climb up the mountain,”
said Tim, “and we may have to
carry Lewis down. He weighs something
over two hundred pounds and that won’t
be any picnic if he can’t walk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll say you need two men then,” said
Cummins. “Looks to me like there’s room
for three or four in that mail hole there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is room enough,” explained
Tim, “but remember we’ll have to count
on bringing Lewis back with us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We could leave a couple of the boys
on the mountain,” said the ranchman.
“Give them plenty of blankets and we can
send after them tomorrow. Sounds to me
like we’ll need lots of help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” agreed Tim. “You pick
the men and we’ll get under way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cummins turned to the cowboys, all of
whom were eager to make the trip.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Curly, Boots and Jim,” he called, and
three husky punchers stepped up to the side
of the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pile in boys,” urged Tim. “You’ll
have to lay down in the mail compartment
and you won’t get a chance to see very much
scenery if you put the top down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Leave her up,” cried Curly, “I’ve always
wanted to see how this dog-goned
country looked from the air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re the doctor,” laughed Tim.
“Don’t blame me if you get pretty cold
on the flight to the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Extra blankets for the punchers who
would stay in the Great Smokies were
stowed aboard and a haversack of food was
handed up to the plane. Then willing
hands swung the mail ship around, Tim
opened the throttle, and they bounced over
the meadow and into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a little more than half an hour Tim
circled over the only level ground on the
side of the mountain. There was a long,
narrow gash that appeared smooth enough
for a landing and he set the mail ship down
cautiously. The first time he overshot the
mark and had to try again. On the second
attempt he made a perfect three point and
killed his speed quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim shut off the motor and climbed out
of his cockpit. The cowboys tumbled
down from the mail compartment while
Cummins tossed the blankets, rope and
hand axes after them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail plane was rolled to some nearby
trees and securely lashed down. Tim
was taking no chances on a sudden wind
destroying their means of escape from the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'>After making sure that the plane was
safe, they started the long climb up the
mountain. At times they moved rapidly,
especially where the wind had swept the
snow off the rocks. But again their progress
was heart-breaking, deep drifts forcing
them to fight for every foot of headway.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up and up they climbed, stopping only
occasionally to rest. The cowboys were in
good physical condition and Tim was glad
that he kept himself in shape. The strenuous
climb might have killed a man who
was not sound in heart and lungs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last, long climb was in sight when
they stopped for a short rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boy,” sputtered Curly, “I’m glad I’m
not a mail pilot. Believe me, I’ll stay on
the ground and chase the dogies. Think
of smashing up in a place like this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is pretty wild,” admitted Tim, “but
the boys don’t crack up very often.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They resumed the climb and managed to
reach the crest of the mountain just as
the sun disappeared behind a higher range
in the west.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tail of the wrecked plane had been
the lone sentinel which had guided them in
their long climb. It had been impaled by
a tooth-like rock that held it firmly. In
the pines on the other slope they could see
the wreckage of the plane and the marks
in the snow plainly showed the course of
the stricken ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rescue party hurried down the steep
slope. Tim, in the lead, was the first to
reach the wreckage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tiny! Tiny!” he called.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tiny! Tiny!” he shouted and the
mountains mocked him with their echoes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim plunged into the wreckage, working
toward the place where he had seen the
arm and face of the pilot when he had discovered
the wreck.</p>

<p class='c004'>With Cummins at his side, he fairly tore
the wreckage apart until they came to the
pilot’s cockpit. An arm through a piece
of canvas was the first indication that Lewis
was still in the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then they found him! He was wedged
into the cockpit. His eyes were closed
and he was breathing slowly. His face was
white in the gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cowboys, with their hand axes,
hacked a path out of the wreckage and they
lifted Lewis from his trap and carried him
out into the open where they spread blankets
and laid him down.</p>

<p class='c004'>The owner of the Circle Four, who professed
to have a slight knowledge of physical
ailments, went over the injured flyer
carefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll probably be on the shelf a few
months,” he said when he had completed
his examination, “but I think he’ll pull
through all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s wrong?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks to me like a considerable number
of broken ribs, and a good hard crack on
the head that might be a slight fracture,
and exposure, of which the exposure is
about as bad as any.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The cowboys built a roaring fire that
cast eerie shadows on the wreckage of the
mail and then proceeded to loosen the injured
flyer’s clothes. Lewis’ body was
thoroughly warmed and the circulation restored
to his arms and feet before they
bundled him up for the trip down the
mountain.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was eight o’clock before they were
ready to start the descent. The hours had
been spent in cutting a plentiful supply of
pine knots which would serve as torches
and in fashioning a stretcher on which to
carry the injured flyer.</p>

<p class='c004'>According to the plan outlined by the
ranchman, four of them would carry the
stretcher while the fifth would go ahead,
lighting the trail with one of the pine
knots.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail flyer was still unconscious
when they placed him on the makeshift
stretcher but he was made comfortable
with an abundance of blankets.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim took one of the forward handles of
the stretcher, Cummins took the other and
Boots and Jim undertook to carry the back
end. Curly, his arms loaded with the pine
fagots, went ahead to light the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stretcher was heavy and bundlesome
and even the short distance to the crest of
the mountain was a cruel struggle. They
were almost exhausted when they reached
the top and put down the stretcher. However,
the rest of the journey to the plane
would be down hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>They alternated carrying the stretcher
and the torches and made fair progress.
When their supply of pine pieces ran low
they were forced to call a halt while Boots
and Jim hunted up a clump of pines and
secured a new supply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The trip down the mountains required
three hours and it was eleven o’clock when
they finally staggered into the clearing that
sheltered the waiting mail plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they let the stretcher down, they
heard the injured flyer groan. Tim bent
low over Lewis.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where am I? What’s happened?” demanded
the air mail pilot, his voice little
more than a whisper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You crashed in the storm,” replied
Tim. “We found you in the Great
Smokies and are getting ready to take you
back to Atkinson. How do you feel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Kind of smashed up inside,” whispered
Lewis.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hang on a couple of hours longer and
we’ll have you in a hospital,” smiled Tim.
“How about it, old man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure, Sure,” was the low reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cowboys helped Tim wheel the
mail plane around and head it down the
narrow clearing. Then they lifted Lewis
into the mail compartment and onto the bed
they had prepared for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim turned to the owner of the Circle
Four.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d better head straight for Atkinson
when I take off,” he said. “Two of the
boys will have to stay here and I’ll bring
the two who go with me back to the ranch
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s all right with us,” agreed Cummins.
“Curly and I will make the trip
with you and Boots and Jim can stay here
tonight. In the morning they can go back
and bring down the mail. The boys from
the ranch will meet them with horses sometime
in the forenoon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Boots and Jim took armsful of the pine
fagots and hurried down the clearing.
They placed flaming torches to light to
take off and Tim started the motor while
Cummins and Curly crawled into the mail
compartment to look after Lewis.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim exercised great care in warming up
the motor. It must not fail him when he
called on it to lift the heavy plane into the
night sky. Finally satisfied that the motor
was functioning perfectly, Tim settled
himself in the cockpit and opened the
throttle. The narrow clearing, dimly outlined
by the uncertain light of the pine
torches, was none too long. The mail plane
started slowly, then gathered speed and
flashed into the night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tim fought the controls as the mail plane
careened down the clearing in the dim light
of the blazing pine torches. He heard,
faintly, the encouraging shouts of Boots
and Jim as they cheered for a successful
takeoff.</p>

<p class='c004'>The odds were terrific. The clearing
was barely long enough for a takeoff with
the best of conditions. The ground was
uneven and the snow materially checked his
speed. Tim waited until the end of the
clearing loomed. Then he pulled back on
the stick and jerked the plane off the
ground. They zoomed into the night sky
and Tim breathed easier, but only for a
second. The motor missed and he felt the
loss of flying speed. He instantly switched
to the other magneto and the motor resumed
its rhythmic firing. It was just in
time for the plane had dropped dangerously
low.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim circled over the clearing, got his
directions, and then headed in a direct airline
for Atkinson. The mail plane hurtled
through the night at one hundred thirty
miles an hour, its maximum speed, and Tim
pushed it every mile of the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was hard work piloting the mail for
every muscle and bone in his body cried
with fatigue. The long hours in the air,
and the struggle up and down the mountain
had sapped his energy. In spite of the cold,
he found it hard to keep awake.</p>

<p class='c004'>The motor droned steadily and its song
lulled Tim into a dangerous state of lassitude.
His eyes grew heavy and once or
twice he caught himself dozing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter realized fully the
danger of going to sleep at the controls
and used every power at his command to
ward off the sleepiness. He beat his arms
against his body, stamped his feet on the
floor of the cockpit and even stood up so
that the icy blast from the propeller beat
against his cheeks. The remedies would be
effective for four or five minutes. Then he
would feel himself slipping again. Each
time it was harder to arouse himself to the
task of moving his arms and legs, of standing
up and facing the chilling slipstream.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were not more than twenty-five
miles from Atkinson when Tim’s eyes
finally closed and his head fell forward. His
hands, which had gripped the stick in desperate
determination, relaxed and the mail
ship cruised on with its pilot asleep in the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>For three or four minutes all went well.
The mail plane, a well rigged craft, maintained
an even keel and Hank Cummins
and Curly, crouched in the mail compartment
with the injured Lewis, had no intimation
that Tim was not at his post of
duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then a vagrant night wind swept out of
the north and caught the plane at a quartering
angle. The stick waggled impatiently
as though signalling Tim that his
attention was needed. Finding no master
hand to control it, the stick gave up the job
and surrendered to the wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail veered off to the south, went
into a tight bank, and ended up in a screaming
nose dive.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wires shrieked as the air speed increased
and the motor added its crescendo
to the din.</p>

<p class='c004'>The plane had dropped one thousand
feet and was less than nine hundred feet
above the ground when the terrific noise
penetrated Tim’s sub-conscious mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he opened his eyes he knew they
were in a power dive, heading for the earth
at nearly two hundred miles an hour.
Without glancing at the altimeter Tim
seized the stick and attempted to bring the
plane out of its dive.</p>

<p class='c004'>The motor pulsated with new power and
gradually, carefully he brought the nose
up. When he felt that the wings would
not snap off under the tremendous strain,
he levelled off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim looked below. Not a hundred feet
away he could see the outline of objects on
the ground. Another second or two of
sleep and they would all have been wiped
out in a crash.</p>

<p class='c004'>He wiped the cold perspiration from his
brow, relaxed just a bit, and set a new course
for Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten minutes later he could see the lights
of the city reflected in the sky and in another
five minutes he was circling down to
a landing on the municipal field.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great Sperry floodlight, used when
the air mail planes were landing or taking
off, bathed the field in its blue-white brilliance.
It was as light as day and Tim set
the heavy ship down as lightly as a feather.
He taxied up to the administration building
and an ambulance, waiting near the gate,
backed down toward his plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They telephoned from the Circle Four
that you had found Lewis and his ship,”
shouted Carl Hunter as he hurried up to
the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Found him on top of a mountain,” replied
Tim. “He’s some smashed up inside
but I think he’ll pull through. The
mail is still in the plane but two of the boys
from the Circle Four are watching it and
they’ll start down with it tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The field manager took charge of the
situation and they lifted the injured flyer
down from the mail cockpit. Lewis was
unconscious again but was breathing deeply
and freely. The young surgeon with the
ambulance gave him a cursory examination.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll pull through all right,” was his
verdict as he swung into the ambulance
and it started its dash for the hospital in
the city.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was so tired and chilled that he had
to be helped from the cockpit. His legs,
aching from the cold and the arduous
exertion of the day, simply folded up under
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hank Cummins grinned at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t feel much better myself,” he
admitted. “And gosh, what an appetite
climbing a mountain gives a fellow. Let’s
eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Supported by the ranchman on one side
and the field manager on the other, Tim
made his way to the administration building.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ralph must have come in early since he
didn’t wait for me,” said Tim as they entered
the manager’s office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter did not answer immediately and
Tim turned toward him with anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter, Carl?” he demanded.
“Isn’t Ralph in; haven’t you
heard from him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We haven’t had any news,” admitted
the field manager, “but you know Ralph
well enough to realize that he can take
care of himself in almost any kind of an
emergency.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim knew that Ralph was capable and
resourceful but he had also had a vivid
demonstration of the dangers of flying in
the Great Smokies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got to start out and hunt for him,”
he cried. “Have the boys get the plane
ready to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” snorted
Hunter. “You’re in no shape to fly. Look
at your eyes. You’d be sound asleep in ten
minutes and then we’d have to start looking
for you. No sir! You stay right here,
put some warm food inside and then roll
in. The mail planes are going through tonight
on schedule and they’ve all been instructed
to look for some sign of a campfire
in the mountains. Ralph may have
found the wrecked westbound, landed, and
be unable to get back into the air again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was sound advice in the field manager’s
words and Tim realized that it would
be folly for him to attempt to fly again
that night.</p>

<p class='c004'>A waiter from the restaurant at the other
end of the administration building brought
in a tray of steaming hot food and Tim,
Hank Cummins, Curly, and Hunter sat
down for a midnight lunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s just one thing I’d like to
know,” said the ranchman. “What in
thunder were you trying to do when you
started for the ground all of a sudden. I
was scared half to death and Curly was
shouting his prayers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To tell the truth I went to sleep,” confessed
Tim. “When I woke up we were
in a power dive and not very far from the
ground. I was scared stiff but Lady Luck
was with us and the wings stayed on when
I pulled the plane out of the dive. Otherwise,
we might not be having hot soup right
now. And boy, does this soup hit the
spot!”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had nearly finished their lunch
when the door opened and the managing
editor of the <em>News</em> hurried in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They phoned me you were coming in
a few minutes ago,” he told Tim. “How
are you? Where’s Ralph? Is Lewis all
right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter answered the managing
editor’s questions as rapidly as possible
and then related the events of the
day. He introduced the managing editor
to Hank Cummins and Curly and told of
the important part the Circle Four men had
taken in the rescue of the injured pilot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s great work, Tim, great,” exclaimed
the managing editor. “If Ralph
isn’t reported by morning you’ll want to
start out again. How about writing the
story for the <em>News</em> before you turn in?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lunch and opportunity to relax had
restored part of Tim’s strength and he was
eager to write the story of the day’s happenings.
It was all fresh and vivid in his
mind. If he went to sleep and tried to
write the story in the morning part of the
dashing action, the brilliant color of the
words, would be lost. He agreed to the
managing editor’s suggestion and sat down
at the typewriter in the field manager’s
office.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a handful of paper on the desk beside
him, he started his story. The other
men in the room continued their conversation
but they might as well have been in
another world as far as Tim was concerned.
He was reliving the events of the day,
transferring the story of what had happened
in the clouds into words and sentences
that would thrill the readers of the <em>News</em>
the next day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Page after page of copy fell from the
machine as Tim’s fingers hammered at the
keys. The managing editor unobtrusively
picked them up and read them with increasing
eagerness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In glowing words Tim painted the story
of the entire events of the day from the sudden
onslaught of the blizzard to the final
landing of his plane on the home field. It
was a story high in human interest—a story
every subscriber of the <em>News</em> would read
and remember.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Tim had completed the last sentence,
he turned to the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m all in,” he admitted, “And if Carl
will lend me a cot in the pilot’s room I’m
going to roll in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You deserve a week of sleep,” said the
managing editor, as he finished reading the
story.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is one of the best yarns you’ve ever
written,” he added enthusiastically. “Now
when Ralph gets in and writes his story—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Carson didn’t finish. He saw the look
of anxiety that his words brought to Tim’s
tired, white face and he added quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You head for bed and we’ll let you
know just as soon as we hear from Ralph.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim nodded dully, almost hopelessly,
and stumbled into the pilot’s room where
he threw himself on a cot. He was asleep
before he had time to draw up the blankets.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later Tim was roused from
his deep slumber by someone shaking his
shoulders. Faintly he heard words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The pilot on the westbound tonight
saw a campfire in the timber along one of
the lower mountains. It must be Ralph.
We’ll start the first thing in the morning.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Tim and Ralph parted in the foothills
of the Great Smokies, Ralph took up
his search for George Mitchell, pilot of
the missing westbound mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Throughout the morning Ralph conducted
his fruitless quest and when noon
came he was forced to turn back from the
mountains and seek a ranch or village where
he could refuel his plane. Ralph’s ship
was slightly smaller than Tim’s and consequently
had a longer cruising radius with
the same fuel load.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten miles north of the regular air mail
route lay the village of Rubio and Ralph
set the mail plane down in a pasture east of
the town. The noise of the plane had drawn
the attention of the villagers and they
swarmed to the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph quickly explained his needs and
the owner of the village garage brought out
a truck loaded with gasoline. Refueling
of the mail ship was soon accomplished and
Ralph then hastened into the village where
he went to the only restaurant and managed
to secure a good, warm meal. He ordered
a large lunch prepared and packed and by
the time he had finished his dinner the
lunch was ready. He paid for the food
and walked back to the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several of the village boys volunteered
to hold the wings while Ralph warmed the
motor. He gave the new fuel a thorough
test and then signalled for the boys to let
go.</p>

<p class='c004'>The propeller sliced through the air and
its blast created a small blizzard which hid
the crowd of villagers in a smother of snow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail ship gathered momentum,
bumped over the uneven ground and finally
bounced into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph headed back for the air mail route
to resume his search. Back and forth he
cruised, confining his search to the foothills
of the mountains for there was slight
chance that Mitchell would have reached
the Great Smokies.</p>

<p class='c004'>The afternoon wore on and Ralph’s
hopes of finding the missing flyer that day
lessened. It was slow and tedious work
cruising over the rolling hills whose slopes
were covered by dense growths of trees,
principally pines.</p>

<p class='c004'>If Mitchell had come down in one of the
forests it might be weeks before he would
be found.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph was speculating on how long his
fuel would last when he saw an irregular
gash in the tops of the trees ahead. He
swung the plane lower. Something had
taken off the tops of half a dozen tall,
scraggly pines. It looked as though some
giant of the sky had paused a moment,
swung a mighty sickle, and then gone on.</p>

<p class='c004'>A quarter of a mile further Ralph saw a
repetition of the broken tree tops. Then
he caught sight of the missing mail plane.
The tail of the ship was sticking straight
up in the air; the nose was buried in a
deep drift at the base of a mighty pine.
The propeller was splintered and the undercarriage
gone but otherwise the plane did
not appear to have been badly damaged.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph gunned his motor hard and
watched for some sign of the pilot near the
wrecked plane. For ten minutes he circled
the spot before looking for a landing
place for his own ship. In one of the valleys
between the foothills he found a small
meadow that looked as though it would
serve as an emergency landing field. He
took careful note of the position of the
wrecked plane and then drifted down to
attempt the landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The meadow was bordered by pines that
stuck their spires into the sky and Ralph
thought for a time that it would be impossible
to avoid their scraggly tops and get
into the meadow. He finally found a break
in the pines and sideslipped through. Then
he straightened out and fishtailed down into
the meadow. The pines had protected the
meadow from the driving north wind of
the night before and the snow had not
drifted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph taxied the mail plane up under the
shelter of the trees, lashed it securely, and
then prepared for his trip to the wrecked
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young reporter took his package of
food he had had prepared at Rubio, ropes
and a hand axe and started the climb up the
foothills. The snow had drifted but little
and he made good progress. In little more
than half an hour he reached the scene of
the wreck of the air mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph shouted lustily, but there was no
response. The tail of the big ship was
pointing straight into the sky. Ralph
could see that Mitchell was not in the
pilot’s cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he gasped with astonishment. The
door of the mail compartment was open.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph ran across the small clearing and
hastily climbed the wings and on up to the
mail compartment. One glance was sufficient.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sack of registered mail was missing!</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no sign of a struggle at the
plane and there was no response to his frantic
shouts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph sat down in the mail cockpit to
think things over. His first thought had
been that the mail had been robbed. He
discarded that belief and decided that
Mitchell, possibly unharmed in the crackup
had taken the precious sack of registered
mail and was attempting to find his way out
of the forest and make for the nearest town.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph dropped down from the fuselage
and started a search in the snow. It was
light and powdery and had drifted just
enough to make the detection of footprints
difficult. The reporter made a careful
search but it was not until he was on the far
side of the plane that his efforts were rewarded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Footprints, almost concealed by the snow
which had fallen later, were dimly visible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, eager and alert, took up the trail
and soon had lost sight of the wreck of the
westbound air mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>The footprints zig-zagged this way and
that for it had been night when Mitchell
had deserted the plane and started to make
his way out of the forest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph plowed steadily through the
snow. The forest was silent except for the
occasional call of a snowbird and Ralph
felt a mighty loneliness around him. The
shadows were lengthening rapidly and
Ralph pushed forward with renewed determination.</p>

<p class='c004'>At intervals the reporter stopped and
listened intently for some sound. It was
possible that Mitchell might call for help.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sundown found the reporter far from
the wreck of the air mail, weaving his way
along the dim trail. Ralph, although little
versed in woodcraft, could read certain
signs in the dim footprints. He could see
that Mitchell had been tiring rapidly.
The steps were more uneven and once or
twice the air mail flyer had stopped beside
some tree to rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light in the forest was fading
rapidly and Ralph advanced as fast as possible.
Once he lost the dim trail and had to
retrace his steps. He begrudged the lost
time and when he found Mitchell’s trail
started at a dog-trot, but with the coming
of the night he was forced to slow down.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter stopped in a small clearing
and called lustily through cupped
hands. Again and again he shouted and
at last he thought he heard a faint reply.
Perhaps it was only an echo. He called
again and a voice, far away, answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Confident that he was near the missing
pilot, Ralph hurried forward, bending almost
double in order to follow the dim
trail. He stopped every few hundred feet
and shouted. Each time the reply came
clearer and stronger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph came out on the bank of a small
stream. Below, on the rocks beside the
creek bed, he saw the crouched form of the
air mail flyer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“George! George!” cried Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down here,” came the reply. “Take it
easy or you’ll slip and twist your ankle just
like I did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In less than a minute Ralph was beside
the man he had been hunting and Mitchell
told him of the events preceding the crash
and how he had attempted to escape from
the forest and reach some habitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The storm struck so quickly I didn’t
have a chance to escape,” said the air mail
flyer as Ralph worked over the twisted
ankle. “The snow and ice collected on the
wings and forced me down. Maybe you
saw where I took the tops off the trees before
I finally cracked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure did,” said Ralph. “Matter of
fact, the only way I found your ship was
through seeing those broken tree tops.
They gave me the clue that a plane had
been in trouble. A little further along I
saw the tail of your ship sticking up in the
air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I took a real flop,” went on the mail
flyer. “Just nosed right straight down and
smacked the old earth. I ducked just in
time and outside a few bruises wasn’t
hurt. Managed to get the sack of registered
stuff out and figured I could get out
of the woods and reach some ranchhouse
or the railroad. Then I fell over this bank,
twisted my right ankle, and I’ve been here
ever since.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph chopped some dry wood from a
dead tree nearby and soon had a fire blazing
merrily among the rocks. He made the
mail flyer as comfortable as possible,
warmed the lunch he had brought with
him and they both enjoyed the meal, the
first Mitchell had eaten in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the lunch had been devoured,
Ralph turned his attention to the injured
ankle. It was a bad wrench but he managed
to fix a makeshift bandage that held
it firm. After that was done he picked
up a blazing piece of firewood and struck
out into the night. In a few minutes he
was back with a forked branch which he
informed Mitchell could be used as a
crutch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph picked up the sack of registered
mail and with his assistance Mitchell managed
to negotiate the steep slope of the
creek valley. When they were in the
woods Ralph went back and extinguished
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter returned and helped support
the mail flyer as they started the slow
and painful journey to the plane which
was to be their means of escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell did the best he could but his
ankle throbbed incessantly and they were
forced to rest every few hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>After an hour and a half of the gruelling
work, Mitchell was exhausted and
Ralph decided that it would be best for
them to wait until morning before continuing
their journey.</p>

<p class='c004'>He selected a clearing which had only
one large tree in the center. Brushing
away the snow he cut enough pine branches
for a makeshift bed and then constructed
a barrier of branches to shield them from
the wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>A fire was started and Mitchell, weak
and chilled from his exertions, laid down
beside it. Ralph massaged the swollen
ankle until the pain had eased and the mail
flyer fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter busied himself securing
enough firewood to last until morning and
after that task was completed laid down beside
Mitchell in the fragrant pine bows.
He dropped into a deep sleep of exhaustion
and had slept for some time when he
awoke with a terrifying fear gripping his
heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Blazing eyes were staring at him from
the edge of the forest; eyes that burned
their way into his mind. A whole ring of
them were closing in, creeping ever nearer
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment the terror of the situation
held Ralph motionless. Then he leaped
into action.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fire had died low but there was still
a few burning embers. He seized the ends
of several of these and hurled them
toward the hungry eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flaming brands made fiery arcs
through the night. Some of them dropped
sizzling into the snow; others struck dark
bodies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hoarse cries shattered the midnight
stillness as the wolves fled before Ralph’s
sudden attack. In a second it was over
and when Mitchell wanted to know what
had happened, Ralph felt as though he
had been dreaming.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wolves were closing in on us when I
woke up,” he explained. “For a minute
I was too scared to do anything. Then I
remembered that they were afraid of fire
and I hurled half a dozen embers from our
campfire at them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never thought of wolves,” said the
mail flyer. “Good thing you woke up or
we might have become 'A Great Mystery’
or some such thing. It wouldn’t take those
timber wolves long to finish a fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph agreed that the wolves were dangerous
and piled new fuel on the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell still had his heavy service automatic
and Ralph appropriated the weapon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bright light from the fire kept
Ralph awake for a time but after an hour
and a half of struggling against fatigue his
eyes closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Stealthy movements in the forest failed
to arouse him and slinking figures emerged
from the timber. The wolves were advancing
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>A dozen of the hungry, grey beasts of
prey crept nearer and nearer the fire. In
an ever narrowing circle they closed in
upon their victims, treading lightly lest
they make some noise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell, exhausted from his long battle
through the snow and the pain of his injured
ankle, was breathing deeply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter had fallen asleep sitting
up and his head was bent forward as though
he was in thought. In his right hand was
the heavy .45 caliber automatic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Closer and closer came the wolves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Forty feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fire crackled as it bit into a pine knot
and the beasts stopped their advance. But
Ralph failed to wake up and the deadly
circle drew nearer to the little camp in the
center of the clearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thirty feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell stirred restlessly and then relapsed
into the deep sleep that claimed
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another moment and the wolves would
spring, their glistening, bared teeth ripping
at their victims. They crept closer,
crouched for the fatal spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fire was lower, its light making only
a dim glow, and through this could be seen
the bright eyes of the wolves.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the heavens came the deep thunder
of the motor of the westbound mail. Its
echoes filled the night and Ralph awakened
instantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wolves, startled by the sudden burst
of sound, were motionless.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the brief second before they leaped,
Ralph threw his body across Mitchell to
shield the injured flyer from the savage onslaught.</p>

<p class='c004'>The automatic in his hand blazed, shattering
the darkness with shafts of flame.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bullets thudded into the gray shapes
which swirled around the dim campfire.</p>

<p class='c004'>A huge timber wolf landed on top of
Ralph. He felt its hot breath, heard the
throaty growl of triumph, felt the muzzle
seek his throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>With desperate effort and strength born
of terror, Ralph pressed the muzzle of the
automatic against the shaggy grey fur.
The shock of the heavy bullet distracted
the wolf and it ceased its efforts to kill
Ralph and slunk into the shadows.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter crouched over Mitchell,
waiting for more onslaughts. The wolf
cries continued and Ralph put more fuel
on the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the light from the leaping flames he
saw the explanation. His first bullets had
brought down two of the huge beasts and
their companions, scenting the fresh blood,
had turned from their attack and were tearing
the stricken wolves to pieces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell handed a fresh clip of cartridges
to Ralph and the reporter sent another
hail of lead in the direction of the
wolves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fresh cries of pain filled the night but
it was not until Ralph had brought down
two more of the great beasts that the others
slunk away and disappeared in the timber.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did they happen to get so close?”
Mitchell asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must have fallen asleep,” admitted
Ralph. “First thing I heard was the roar
of the westbound plane going over and then
I saw a whole circle of hungry eyes looking
at us. They were crouched, ready to
spring, when the sound of the plane distracted
them. It gave me just time enough
to get into action with the gun.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing you did or all that would
have been left of us by morning would be
soup bones,” grinned Mitchell. “I’ve had
all the thrills I want for one night. I’m
not going to risk going to sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter and the mail flyer sat up
and talked for the remainder of the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the first lightening of the sky, they
resumed their journey toward the plane.
In the clearing they left the bodies of four
wolves and further along the trail they
found the body of a fifth, the one which
had leaped upon Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>They finally reached the wreck of the
mail plane and continued until they came
to the clearing where Ralph had left his
ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not any too much room to get out of
this pocket,” commented Mitchell as he
surveyed the tall pines which enclosed the
valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had to fish tail in and dodge a few
trees doing it,” replied Ralph. “But if I got
in I guess I’ll be able to get out all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell rested in the snow while Ralph
unlashed the plane and turned it around.
Then the reporter boosted the flyer into the
mail cockpit and prepared for the take-off.
He primed the motor and felt that luck
was with him when it started easily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell leaned out of the mail cockpit
and shouted back at Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know this ship,” he cried. “Let her
get a good run. Then pull back hard and
she’ll climb almost straight up. Don’t hold
her in a climb for more than two hundred
feet or she may slip back on back and go
into a tail spin.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph nodded his thanks and made a
final check to see that the plane was ready
for the attempt to get out of the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tall pines loomed on every side.
Straight ahead there was a slight break in
the tree tops he hoped to be able to slide
through. It would require skilful piloting
but they had passed through so many ordeals
in the last few hours that Ralph felt
himself capable of meeting the emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter leaned ahead and tapped
Mitchell on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All set?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then hang on,” cried Ralph and he
opened the throttle and sent the plane
skimming through the snow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The barrier of pines rose ahead of the
propeller. Ralph waited until the last
second and then jerked the stick back. The
wheels lifted off the ground and the ship
flashed into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was going to be close but it looked like
they would clear the trees and wing their
way eastward in safety. Ralph whipped
the plane through the narrow opening in
the tree tops. They were almost clear
when one wing brushed the snow-burdened
tips of the pine. It was just enough to
throw the plane out of balance. They lost
speed and the nose started down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph had visions of being impaled on
the tops of the trees and he worked frantically
to right the plane. Lower and lower
they slipped. Then the motor overcame
the pull of gravity and they resumed their
climb. Two tall trees barred their way
and Ralph banked sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a sudden jar as though some
giant had reached up to pluck the plane
from the sky. Then it was over and they
were soaring towards the clouds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mitchell, who had been watching their
progress, relaxed and slumped down into
the mail cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, perplexed by the last jarring
sensation as they cleared the final barrier,
wondered what had happened to the ship.
The wing tips had not been damaged and
the tail assembly was all right.</p>

<p class='c004'>Determined to find out what had taken
place, Ralph leaned far out of the cockpit
in order to see the landing gear. One
glance was sufficient. The left wheel had
been smashed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph slid back into his seat and gave
his attention to the handling of the plane.
He had more than an hour in which to
decide how he would land at Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky cleared and the sun peeped over
the horizon. The last snow of winter
would soon be little more than a memory
but it would be a bitter one for the air
mail with two planes wrecked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Atkinson was just waking up when
Ralph roared over and circled the airport.
He swooped low to attract attention and
first on the field was Tim, who had been
awakened by the sound of the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One wheel of Ralph’s ship is
smashed!” cried Hunter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I’ll bet he hasn’t got a whole lot
of gas left,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What will we do?” asked Carson, who
had returned to the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take a wheel up to him,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning to the field manager, he asked,
“Have you got a spare wheel that will fit
that ship?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two of them,” said Hunter. “I’ll
have them in in less than a minute.” He
hastened to the parts room and returned
with a spare wheel. Together they ran to
hangar No. 5 which was the home of the
<em>Good News</em>. The plane, repainted and
with its motor and rigging carefully
checked, was ready to go again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You handle the controls,” Tim told
Hunter, “and I’ll do the plane changing
stunt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter warmed up the <em>Good News</em> and
Tim secured the extra equipment he
needed. He tossed a coil of rope into the
forward cockpit and put an assortment of
wrenches of various sizes into the pockets
of his tight-fitting leather jacket. Then
he vaulted into the cockpit and signalled
for Hunter to open the throttle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> flipped through the
open door of the hangar, made a short run,
and then, its powerful motor thrumming
steadily, nosed skyward in a steep climb.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter took the <em>Good News</em> alongside
the slower mail plane and Tim signalled
to Ralph what he intended to attempt.
Mitchell, who was now aware of the danger
of their situation, was watching anxiously
from the mail cockpit of Ralph’s
plane. Himself an expert flier, he was
fuming impatiently at his helplessness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter and Ralph coordinated the speed
of their planes and Hunter gradually edged
over the other plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim made one end of the rope fast to
the cockpit and to the other he tied the
spare wheel. He lowered the wheel over
the side of the fuselage and slowly let it
down until it was just above Mitchell. The
mail flyer reached up and took the wheel,
untying the rope to which it had been fastened.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Tim pulled the rope back, knotted
it in half a dozen places, and tossed it overboard
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it easy,” he warned Hunter as he
unfolded his long legs and eased them over
the side of the cockpit. The air was cold
and clinging to a swaying rope one thousand
feet above the ground while traveling
ninety miles an hour was no picnic. Little
by little Tim slid down the swaying rope.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph watched the controls of his plane
like a hawk, creeping nearer and nearer to
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gap between Tim and the upper
wing of the mail plane lessened—almost
vanished. Then the flying reporter let go
and sprawled on the wing, his hands clutching
the forward wing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The drop had knocked the breath from
his body and he gasped painfully. After
a short rest he felt his strength returning
and started edging toward the center of the
ship. Ralph held the plane steady and Tim
made good progress. In less than five minutes
he was in the mail cockpit with
Mitchell.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a few words the injured pilot told
Tim what had happened, of his own crash
and attempt to get out of the timber with
the registered mail, how Ralph had found
him and later fought off the wolves and
how they had smashed a wheel in getting
clear of the trees surrounding the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim told Mitchell that he had found
Lewis, the other missing pilot, and brought
him safely to Atkinson. That done, Tim
took the wheel and slide out of the cockpit
and down on to the landing gear.</p>

<p class='c004'>The axle was only slightly bent and was
still strong enough to stand the strain of
landing in the snow. Tim worked hard to
get the lock nut off the smashed wheel for
it had jammed. He finally worked it loose
and then dropped the damaged wheel on to
the flying field far below.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new wheel slid into place and he
managed to get the lock nut on. The wheel
wobbled a little but it would permit Ralph
to land in safety.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim clambered back into the mail
cockpit and motioned for Ralph to land. The
pilot brought the mail ship down to an
easy landing and taxied up to the row of
hangars where they were met by the impatient
managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>A photographer was waiting and he
snapped half a dozen pictures as Ralph and
Tim helped Mitchell from the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flyer was sent in to town for treatment
at a hospital and Tim and Ralph accompanied
the managing editor to the
<em>News</em> office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you want something to eat?”
asked Carson as they reached the office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll wait,” grinned Ralph. “If I eat
now I’ll go to sleep and you’ll never wake
me up. I’ll write the story first and eat
afterward.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER NINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The afternoon editions of the <em>News</em> that
day featured the stories Tim and Ralph had
written of their adventures in rescuing the
air mail pilots. Pictures of Ralph’s plane
landing and of Ralph and Tim helping
George Mitchell were spread all over the
second page.</p>

<p class='c004'>But long before the presses started their
daily run Tim was in the air again, refreshed
by at least part of a night’s sleep.
Ralph, exhausted by his adventures and
lack of sleep, went to bed as soon as he finished
writing his story.</p>

<p class='c004'>After returning to the airport, Tim prepared
to take his cowboy friends back to
the Circle Four Ranch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hank Cummins, the owner of the Circle
Four, was waiting for Tim at the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just had a telephone call from the
ranch,” he said, “and by the time we get
there they’ll have the mail down where we
can pick it up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That will be fine,” exclaimed Tim.
“I’ll have it back here by late afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim warmed up the <em>Good News</em> and
motioned for the ranchman and Curly to
climb into the forward cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better strap yourselves in,” he warned
them. “This ship steps out and we’re going
places. If we happen to hit some rough
air you’ll think you’re riding a bronco.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Curly grinned as though he thought
Tim was joking but the flying reporter insisted
that the cowboy strap himself in the
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> was pulsating with
power and Tim decided to give his new
friends a thrill or two.</p>

<p class='c004'>He opened the throttle and the plane
dusted down the field like a scared jackrabbit.
Tim pulled back hard on the stick
and the powerful motor took them almost
straight into the sky. Up and up they
spiraled, clawing for altitude and getting it
by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five hundred, seven-fifty, one thousand,
fifteen hundred and then two thousand.
They were flashing away from the earth
at a dizzying pace. When the plane was
about the two thousand foot level, Tim
levelled off and headed in the direction of
the Circle Four.</p>

<p class='c004'>The air speed indicator started to
climb. There was a favoring wind to boost
them along and the needle advanced steadily.
They breezed along at a hundred and
eighty miles an hour and when Tim pushed
the speed up to one hundred and ninety
miles an hour Curly turned around. His
face was white and scared looking. He
motioned for Tim to slow down and the
flying reporter shut off the motor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to get home in a minute,”
yelled the cowboy. “Take your time, take
your time. All I’ve got to do when we get
home is chase cows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim grinned and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You haven’t seen anything yet,” he
cried. “If you think a horse can buck,
watch this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter switched on the
motor again and fed fuel into the white-hot
cylinders. Their speed increased until
they were flashing through the sky at two
hundred and five miles an hour. Curly and
Hank Cummins were clinging to the combing
of the front cockpit, their knuckles
white from the desperation of their grip.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim eased up on the throttle and slowed
down to the sedate pace of one hundred and
fifty miles an hour. Curly and Hank
settled down in their seats, only to lose their
hats when Tim swung the <em>Good News</em> into
a loop. From that he dropped into a falling
leaf and ended up by flying upside down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can a bronco do stunts like that?”
asked Tim when the <em>Good News</em> was again
on an even line of flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One or two,” Curly managed to say,
“but they can’t buck upside down for that
long a time. Take me home. I’ll be glad
to get out of this sky horse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> fairly snapped the miles
out of its exhaust and it was only a short
time after they had left the field at Atkinson
when Tim brought the plane to rest
in the meadow below the ranch buildings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Boots and Jim were waiting for him
with the sacks of mail they had taken from
the wreckage of Lewis’ plane in the Great
Smokies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim checked the sacks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Every one of them here and nothing
damaged,” he said. “By night they’ll be
on their way east again by air mail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hank Cummins urged him to go to the
ranch house for a warm lunch, but Tim
refused the invitation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then pay us a visit this summer when
you have your vacation,” insisted the owner
of the Circle Four. “Come out here with
the boys. They’ll teach you how to ride
and rope and maybe do a little fancy shooting.
There’s good fishing in the streams
back in the hills and maybe, if the rustling
that started last summer keeps on, you
might run into a little excitement.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In that case,” smiled Tim, “I wouldn’t
be surprised if you had a couple of reporters
spending their vacations with you this
summer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing would please me more,” said
the genial ranchman, “and be sure and
drop in whenever you fly this way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks for all you’ve done,” said Tim,
“and if we can ever do you a favor, don’t
hesitate to call on us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the air mail pouches in the forward
cockpit Tim headed the <em>Good News</em>
for home. The headwind slowed him
somewhat but even with that handicap he
was back in Atkinson by mid-afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>A special section of the air mail eastbound
had just come in and the salvage
mail was placed aboard it to continue the
journey to eastern cities.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the air mail had taken off, Hunter
turned to Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m writing a complete report and forwarding
it to headquarters,” said the field
manager. “It was certainly great of you
and Ralph to help out as you did. Lewis
might have died and Mitchell certainly
would have had a rough time of it before
we could have reached them if you fellows
hadn’t volunteered.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re always ready in an emergency,”
said Tim. “Besides, we got some dandy
stories for the paper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The company will reward you in some
way,” said Hunter, “And they won’t be
stingy about it when they read my report.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t lay it on too thick,” urged Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not very much,” grinned Hunter as
he went into his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was about to leave the field when
Hunter called that he was wanted on the
phone. When Tim answered he recognized
the voice of Captain Ned Raymond
of the state police.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to see you at the Hotel Jefferson
right away. Same room as before,”
said the Captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m just starting for town,” replied
Tim. “I’ll be there in fifteen or twenty
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond was pacing up and
down the narrow confines of room 309
when Tim entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Glad to see you again, Murphy,” said
the state police official. “Sit down,” and
he waved toward the bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond continued his pacing,
chewing nervously at the end of a heavy
pencil.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trouble brewing,” he said in the sharp,
short way of his. “Got a tip from Chicago
today. We’ll have to keep a sharp lookout.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just what for?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s it, that’s it,” exploded the fiery
policeman. “If I knew where to look,
but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we’ll have to sit back and wait
for something to happen.” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But keep our eyes open,” added Captain
Raymond. “My tip is that some of
the members of the Sky Hawk’s gang have
worked out a new scheme of some kind
and are planning a lot of robberies. Going
to make a wholesale business out of it.
Our part of the country has been picked
first because it will be easy for them to
make a getaway. The mountains west of
here, the river east. Good hiding for anyone
who is evading the law.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim waited while Captain Raymond
continued his pacing of the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have that plane of yours ready to
go at a minute’s notice,” said the trooper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s always ready,” replied Tim, “For
we never know just when a big story will
break and we’ll need the plane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good, good. And have no fear but
what you’ll get all the excitement you want
in a short time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve had about all I want for a while,”
smiled Tim and he told of what he and
Ralph had gone through in the rescue of
the air mail flyers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the stuff,” explained Captain
Raymond. “You boys are just the types
we need. I know I can count on you to
come through in an emergency. Guess
that’s all for this time. I just wanted to
warn you to expect trouble soon. If you
want to get in touch with me at any time
telephone the troop barracks at Harris. If
I’m not there, they’ll know where to locate
me within a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Tim left the hotel it was with the
knowledge that he would soon be in conflict
with members of the Sky Hawk’s old
band. He knew they would be formidable
foes but there was no fear in his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter returned to the <em>News</em>
office and started writing his aviation column
for the following day. He was tired
and made slow progress, but he had a little
more than a column of material ready when
he closed his desk at six o’clock.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dan Watkins, the head of the copy desk
and one of Tim’s closest friends, was waiting
for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you going to eat tonight?”
asked the copy chief.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anyplace where it is quiet,” replied
Tim. “My head feels a little light.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then some clam chowder could just
about hit the spot with you,” suggested
Watkins and they left the <em>News</em> building
and walked to a small, cozy restaurant on a
nearby sidestreet. The quiet and the soft
lights eased Tim’s taut nerves and he felt
his whole body relaxing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve had some mighty busy days,”
commented Watkins when they were comfortably
seated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Busy but lots of fun,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about the chances you’ve been
taking?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They weren’t chances,” said the flying
reporter. “I always had a sturdy plane
and I tried to use good judgment. Once or
twice, I’ll admit that I took chances but in
those cases the object far surpassed the
risk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard the business manager and the
managing editor talking about you today,”
said Watkins.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t my work up to standard?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wasn’t about your work it was about
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Both of them are worried about your
health. They are afraid you’re working
too hard and when the managing editor
and the business manager start to worry
about your health you can bet your bottom
dollar you’re valuable to the paper. With
me, I could have a nervous breakdown and
they’d never bat an eye. Probably be glad
to get rid of me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t talk like that, Dan,” pleaded
Tim. “You know that’s not so. Why
you’re the balance wheel of the editorial
office. Carson wouldn’t know what to do
if anything happened to you. He depends
on you to keep things running smoothly, see
that the boys all cover their assignments and
that the copy goes steadily to the machines.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t argue over that,” smiled the
copy chief, “But you should have heard
those two going at it this afternoon. The
business manager fairly ripped into Carson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For letting you be sworn into the state
police.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know that!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s my business to know things like
that. Anyway, the business manager said
the state police could take care of themselves
and that you were too valuable for
the paper to lose. He said that hundreds
of people took the <em>News</em> just to read about
the adventures you and Ralph go through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did Carson say?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh he explained what the state troopers
were up against and they had it hot and
heavy for a while. All of which gets back
to what I wanted to say to you. Be careful,
Tim, on this state police job. The troopers
are paid to take chances with criminals;
you’re not. Help them where you can but
don’t risk your own life unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t intend to take unnecessary
risks,” said Tim, “but you know how I
feel about crime. Anything I can do to
stop it or, after it is committed, to bring the
criminals to justice, I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I realize that, Tim, and I admire you
for it,” said Watkins. “All I ask is that
you be careful. The <em>News</em> has done a great
deal for you and it will do a great deal
more if you give it a chance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Routine work filled the next ten days and
there was no further news from Captain
Raymond of the state police. The warm
winds of spring swept in from the south
and the last traces of the late winter blizzard
disappeared. The grass sprang up
and the trees started to leaf.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the lunch hour the reporters
gathered on the south side of the <em>News</em>
building to exchange yarns and gossip.
Gray skies of winter had been replaced by
the cheerful ones of spring and life on the
paper moved smoothly. The menace of
the Sky Hawk’s gang had almost been forgotten
when Tim was given an assignment
that was to lead to many a strange and
thrilling adventure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER TEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Tim returned to the editorial room
after lunch that day the managing editor
summoned him to his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got an assignment that is somewhat
different from your usual run of
things,” explained Carson, “but I’m sure
you’ll enjoy it. The Southwestern railroad
is speeding up the time of its midnight
mail. The new schedule calls for an average
speed of fifty-one miles an hour. The
superintendent of this division has invited
me to send a reporter on the first trip tonight.
How would you like to ride the
cab of the mail down to Vinton?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like it, Mr. Carson,” replied Tim.
“I’ve always wanted to ride in the cab of
a fast train.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have your chance tonight,”
smiled the managing editor, “for if I know
anything about train schedules the mail is
going to throw the miles up her stack when
she hits her stride.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Carson telephoned the railroad offices
that Tim would ride the cab that night.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’d better go down to the station
about eleven o’clock,” said the managing
editor. “You’ll get your pass at the ticket
office. Then go down to the roundhouse
and get aboard the engine there. The engineer
and conductor will be expecting you.
This is quite an event for the railroad
people and I want to give them a good yarn.
I’ll send Ralph to Vinton this afternoon
in the <em>Good News</em> and he’ll wait there and
bring you home in the morning. One of
the staff photographers will be at the station
to take flash-lights when the mail pulls
out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll finish my aviation column for tomorrow,”
said Tim, “and then get some
old clothes for I don’t imagine it will be
any too clean on the engine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Ralph returned from an assignment
he was told to take the <em>Good News</em>
and fly to Vinton, there to await the arrival
of Tim on the midnight mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim accompanied his flying companion
to the airport and helped him wheel the
<em>Good News</em> out of the hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Traveling on a train will seem kind of
slow compared to the <em>Good News</em>,” suggested
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know about that,” replied Tim.
“The mail’s new schedule is a hair raiser
and they’ll have to pound the steel pretty
hard to make their time. It won’t be any
picnic, I can tell you that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, satisfied that the motor was
thoroughly warm and ready for its task,
waved at Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See you in the morning,” he called.
Then he whipped the <em>Good News</em> across
the field and streaked into the southwest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim watched the plane until it disappeared
before he turned to the car which
had brought them from town. On his way
back to the city he drove leisurely, thoroughly
enjoying the sweetness of the spring
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The road swung onto a viaduct that
spanned the myriad rails of the Southwestern.
A transcontinental limited was
pulling into the long station, feathery puffs
of steam drifting away from the safety
valve. The train came to a stop, porters
swung their stools down on the platform
and the passengers descended. The engineer
dropped down from the cab and
started oiling around the iron speedster of
the rails.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was something thrilling, fascinating
about it and Tim looked forward with
high interest to his trip that night. He
drove on up town, returning the car to the
garage.</p>

<p class='c004'>After dinner alone he walked to his
room, found a suit of coveralls and an old
cap and bandanna handkerchief. These he
rolled up and wrapped in paper. That
done he sat down for an hour of reading the
latest aviation journals and at eight o’clock
he set his alarm clock for ten-thirty and
laid down for a nap.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next thing Tim knew the alarm was
ringing steadily and he roused himself
from the deep sleep into which he had
fallen. He washed his face and hands in
cold water and felt greatly refreshed, ready
for whatever the night might have in store
in the way of adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way to the station Tim stopped
at an all night restaurant and enjoyed a
platter of delicious country sausage. Then
he continued his walk toward the railroad
yards.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter descended the steps from
the viaduct and entered the brightly lighted
station. It was two minutes to eleven when
he walked up to the ticket window and introduced
himself. The agent on duty
handed him his credentials and told him
the shortest way to the roundhouse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim left the station and its glow of light.
Outside the night air was cool and he pulled
his leather jacket closer around him. Great
arc lights gleamed at intervals in the yard
and a chugging switch engine disturbed the
quiet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Three blocks from the station was the
roundhouse with its countless chimneys and
numberless doors. Tim picked his way
carefully over the switches, skirted the
yawning pit that marked the turn-table and
entered the master mechanic’s office at the
roundhouse.</p>

<p class='c004'>The master mechanic, old Tom Johnson,
was checking over the schedule of the mail
with Fred Henshaw, who was to pull the
mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want?” growled Johnson
when he saw Tim standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m from the <em>News</em>,” replied Tim.
“The superintendent wanted a reporter to
ride the mail tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s your name?” asked the master
mechanic.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tim Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, so you’re the flying reporter,”
smiled Johnson as he got out of his chair
and shook hands with Tim. “I’ve read a
lot about you. Glad to know you. Meet
Fred Henshaw. He’ll give you a few
thrills tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and the engineer shook hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t go as fast as you do by plane,”
smiled the engineer, “But we’ll go places.”
“I’m looking forward to the trip,” said
Tim. “It will be a real experience.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The telephone rang and the master mechanic
answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The dispatcher says the mail will be in
on the advertised,” he said. “That gives
us a break for the test run.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw nodded and motioned for Tim
to accompany him into the roundhouse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Electric lights high up under the roof
tried vainly to pierce the shadows which
shrouded the hulking monsters of the rails
as they rested in their stalls. There must
have been fourteen or fifteen locomotives
in the roundhouse, some of them dead;
others breathing slowly and rhythmically,
awaiting their turn to be called for service
on the road.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the far end of the roundhouse there
was a glare of light as hostlers finished
grooming the 1064 for its run that night
on the mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>The 1064 was the latest thing the Southwestern
boasted in the way of fast-passenger
motive power. It was capable of
hauling sixteen all-steel Pullmans at
seventy miles an hour and was as sleek and
trim as a greyhound.</p>

<p class='c004'>The engineer took his torch and made
a final inspection to be sure that everything
was in readiness for the test run. Then he
extinguished the torch, threw it up into the
cab, and motioned for Tim to follow him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little engineer scrambled up the
steps and swung into the cab. Tim followed
but with not nearly as much grace.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fireman was busy with a long firehook
and the glow from the open door of
the firebox lighted the cab with a ruddy
brilliance. When the iron doors of the
firebox slammed shut and the fireman
straightened up, the engineer introduced
his fireman, Harry Benson.</p>

<p class='c004'>Introductions completed, the engine
crew fixed a place for Tim on the seat behind
the engineer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw looked at his watch. It was
eleven forty-five. He stuck his head out
the window and looked at the turn-table.
It had been swung into place ready for the
1064 to steam out of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Harry Benson started the bell ringer,
Henshaw released the air and opened the
throttle a notch. The 1064 came to life,
steam hissed from its cylinders, the drivers
quivered and moved slowly in the reverse
motion. The 1064 slid out of the roundhouse,
rocked a little as it went over the
turn-table and then eased down the darkened
yards until it came to a stop near the
end of the long train shed.</p>

<p class='c004'>At eleven-fifty a penetrating whistle
came through the night to be followed several
minutes later by the blazing headlight
of the westbound mail.</p>

<p class='c004'>The long string of mail cars came to a
halt in front of the station, the engine
which had brought them in was cut off, and
steamed down the yard on its way to the
roundhouse. A lantern at the head end of
the mail signalled for the 1064 to back
down and Henshaw set the engine in motion
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a delicate handling of the air he
nosed the tender of the 1064 against the
head mail car. The work of coupling the
engine to the train was a matter of seconds.
Then Henshaw tested the air. It worked
perfectly and the midnight mail was ready
to continue its westward race across the
continent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The interior of the cab was lighted by
a green-shaded bulb just above the gauges
on the boiler. The sides were in the shadows
and there was no reflection to bother
the engineer as he stared into the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conductor ran forward along the
train and handed a sheaf of order tissues
into the cab. Henshaw and his fireman
read them together to make sure that they
understood every order.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Slow order for that new bridge at
Raleigh is going to hurt,” was the only
comment the engineer made as he climbed
back on his box.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mail trucks rumbled along the platform
as extra crews hastened the work of unloading
and loading the mail. Then they
were through. The mail was ready for the
open steel.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conductor’s lantern at the back end
of the train flashed in the “high ball” and
Henshaw answered with two short, defiant
blasts of the whistle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The engineer dusted the rails with sand,
opened the throttle, and the 1064 settled
down to its night’s work. With nine steel
cars of mail to hold it down, the giant engine
plunged out of the yards.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over the switches they clattered, the
cab rocking and reeling as they struck the
frogs. They had a straight shot through
the yards to the main line and Henshaw
wasted no time in getting the 1064 into
its stride.</p>

<p class='c004'>They flashed past the outer signal towers
and now only two twin ribbons of steel lay
ahead of them. The mail was speeding
down the right-hand westbound track.
They would meet the eastbound trains
coming down the left-hand pair of rails.</p>

<p class='c004'>The needle on the speed indicator
mounted steadily as Henshaw opened the
throttle notch by notch. The 1064’s exhaust
was a steady, deafening volley that
made conversation impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Block signals popped up in the searching
rays of the headlight to disappear in
the thunder of the train almost before Tim
had time to read their signals. But the
engineer saw them all and knew that the
steel highway ahead of him was clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Harry Benson was busy feeding the fire.
He swayed to and fro in the glare from the
open firebox. First to the tender, then
to the cab with a scoop of coal, then back
to the tender for more coal.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the time the mail was five miles out
of Atkinson, Henshaw had the 1064 near
the peak of its stride. They were rolling
down the line at better than seventy miles
an hour. It was a dizzy pace and the
cab rocked and rolled over the steel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim marveled at the easy grace of the
fireman as he swung back and forth between
the cab and the tender, feeding great
shovels of coal into the hungry firebox.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mail flashed through sleeping
villages and past darkened farmhouses.
The country through which they were
speeding was sparsely settled and there
were few grade crossings. Only occasionally
did Henshaw reach for the
whistle cord and send a sharp warning into
the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>Raleigh was their first scheduled stop
and five miles this side of the city they
slid down into a valley where a roaring
stream rushed under the rails. A repair
crew had been strengthening the bridge and
had not quite completed their work. As a
result the dispatcher had put out a slow
order which called for a speed not in excess
of thirty miles an hour over the bridge.
Henshaw glanced at his watch and grumbled
to himself as he pinched the mail
down to comply with the orders. The air
brakes ground hard on the wheels and Tim
looked back at the train. Sparks were
flying from every truck, cascading in showers
along the right-of-way.</p>

<p class='c004'>They rumbled over the bridge and Henshaw
opened up again. Every minute
counted and he rolled the mail into Raleigh
at a lively clip.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no need to handle the mail
as he would a crack transcontinental limited
with extra fare passengers and a diner full
of chinaware and Henshaw whipped the
mail into the station and ground her down
hard. They stopped with a jerk that
jarred every bone in Tim’s body.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doors of the mail cars were rolled
open and the crew started tossing the
pouches. Henshaw picked up his torch,
lighted it, and dropped down to oil around
while Benson pulled the spout down from
the nearby water tank and gave the engine
a drink.</p>

<p class='c004'>High speed means lots of steam and
steam means water and more water. Hundreds
of gallons gushed into the tank on the
tender and the fireman had just completed
his task when they got the highball. He
was still on top of the tender when Henshaw
cracked his throttle and started the
mail on another leg of its fast run.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fireman scrambled down off the
swaying tender, opened the firebox, and
started throwing in coal like a man
possessed. There was a slight grade out
of the station at Raleigh and the laboring
exhaust fairly pulled the fire out the
stack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once over the grade the 1064 hit her
stride and they rolled away along the foothills
of the Great Smokies. This particular
main stem of the Southwestern ran
through the foothills for several hundred
miles, finally finding a pass through which
the rails continued their journey to the
coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>The running would be more precarious
now and there was only one more stop and
that for water at the village of Tanktown,
a hamlet where a few railroad men made
their home.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was fascinated by the precision with
which the great locomotive worked, with
the confidence the engineer displayed in its
handling and with the dexterity of the fireman
as he fed fuel to the firebox.</p>

<p class='c004'>On and on rushed the mail, the speed
never under sixty miles an hour and sometimes
well over seventy. Just before they
plunged into the foothills they struck a
stretch of ten miles of almost straight track
with only one or two gentle grades.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw yelled at his fireman and Benson
grinned and motioned for the engineer
to open the throttle. The bar went back
into the last notch and Tim felt the engine
pulsate with new power. The needle on
the speed indicator climbed to seventy-five
and kept on. It paused at eighty and then
went on up to eighty-three. They were
bouncing around in the cab when the little
air whistle which the conductor uses in
signalling the engine peeped.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw waited until the conductor had
signalled several times before he eased off
on the throttle and they dropped down to
the slow pace of sixty-five miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess we gave the boys behind a
thrill,” yelled Henshaw and the fireman
nodded as he straightened up to rest his
weary muscles.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once in the foothills where the grades
were frequent and the curves tighter, their
speed dropped below sixty miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they stopped at Tanktown for
coal and water, they were seven minutes
ahead of their schedule and Henshaw took
ample time to touch up the journals and
bearings of the great engine with liberal
doses of oil.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conductor ran forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the idea,” he demanded. “Were
you trying to put us all in the ditch?”
“Keep cool, keep cool,” grinned Henshaw.
“Our orders were to make time and
we made it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our orders didn’t call for eighty-three
miles an hour,” sputtered the trainman.
“Next time you try a stunt like that I’ll
pull the air on you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll lose time if you do,” smiled the
engineer. “You sit back in your mail cars
and I’ll do the worrying about keeping the
train on the rails.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The fireman yelled that he was ready to
go. Henshaw looked at his watch and
climbed into the cab.</p>

<p class='c004'>The whistle blasted two short, sharp
calls and the flagman on the back end swung
aboard. The mail sped on the last lap of
its inaugural run on the new schedule.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mile after mile disappeared behind the
red lights of the last car. They were less
than forty miles from the end of the division
when they swung around a curve to
see the rails ahead of them disappear in an
inferno of flame.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw jammed on the air and leaned
far out of the cab. Tim dropped down in
the gangway and looked ahead. A small
patch of timber through which the right-of-way
passed was on fire, and a wall of
flame barred their way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The engineer pinched his train down to
a stop about two hundred yards from the
burning timber. Even at that distance
they could hear the roar of the flames and
feel the heat from the cauldron of fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like this is the end of your run,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know,” replied the engineer.
“We might make it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going to try and run the fire?” asked
the fireman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Orders say to get the mail through to
the west end on time,” said the engineer,
“And orders are orders. What say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say yes,” grinned the fireman. “The
steel ought to hold us and we can coast
through without much push or pull on the
rails.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m riding the mail,” said Tim when
the engineer turned to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then here we go,” decided Henshaw.
He threw over the reverse lever and started
backing away from the flames. When the
1064 was a mile from the burning timber
he brought the train to a stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mail clerks and trainmen had their heads
out the doors, wondering what the engineer
was going to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conductor hurried up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to stay here,” he told the
engineer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stay here? Well, I guess not,” replied
Henshaw. “Orders say 'on time’ at the
west end. If you’re going to stay with this
train, swing on and make it snappy. We’re
going to run for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The conductor protested but the
engineer set his train in motion and the conductor
finally swung on one of the mail cars
and climbed inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>The 1064 picked up speed rapidly and
they rolled down on the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Duck down behind the boiler when I
yell,” said the engineer and Tim and the
fireman nodded that they understood.</p>

<p class='c004'>The distance between the pilot and the
flames was decreasing rapidly. Tim slid
off the box behind the engineer and clung
to one side of the cab. The world ahead
was a wall of fire that leaped toward the
heavens. Tim heard the engineer yell and
he ducked behind the head of the boiler.</p>

<p class='c004'>The engine swayed sickeningly but held
to the steel. There was the roar of the
fire, the stifling heat that seemed to sear
its way into his lungs, hot brands filled the
cab and he felt his hair scorching in the
terrific heat. Then the engine stumbled
onto cool steel and they were through the
burning timber and into the cool night air
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim shook the cinders from his hair and
straightened up. He looked for the engineer
and found Henshaw industriously
beating out tongues of flame which were
licking around the window. Between flailing
his arms at the fire he would stop momentarily
to widen out on the throttle as
the 1064 swung into her stride again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporter turned to the fireman’s side
of the cab. Benson was missing.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a cry of alarm, Tim summoned
the engineer from his side of the cab.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fireman’s gone!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both of them felt the hand of death
grip at their hearts. Perhaps a lurch of
the cab had thrown Benson out and into the
flaming woods. There would have been
no chance for his survival and they looked
at each other with horror written in their
faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>The shock of the sudden tragedy left
Tim speechless and the engineer climbed
slowly back to his throttle. There was no
joy in the cab of the 1064 over their victory
with the flames for Henshaw had lost the
best fireman he had ever had.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was used to sudden shocks but the
one of turning to look for the fireman and
finding him gone was one that would remain
with him through life.</p>

<p class='c004'>The needle on the steam gauge wavered
and started down as the 1064 made its
heavy demands for power. Someone must
keep the fire hot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw glanced anxiously at his
watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re right on the dot now,” he
shouted at Tim. “If you can throw the
black diamonds for about thirty minutes
we’ll go into the west end on time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll do my best,” shouted Tim above
the noise of the madly working machinery.</p>

<p class='c004'>A foot lever which operated a small
steam engine opened the door of the firebox
and Tim stepped on the lever. The heavy
iron doors swung open and he looked into
a white-hot pit. The fire was thin in spots
and he picked up Benson’s scoop, set his
legs for the pitch and roll of the cab, and
swung a scoop of coal into the firebox. The
first one went where he intended it but on
the second attempt they struck a tight curve
and most of the coal went up the engineer’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better luck next time,” he shouted encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim took a fresh grip on the scoop and
in less than five minutes had an even bed of
coal scattered over the firebox.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was something strange and mysterious
about the woods being on fire and
it troubled Tim, who sought some solution
as he swayed from tender to firebox and
back to tender. Here it was, the spring of
the year, and that patch of woods afire.
A campfire started by tramps might have
spread, but Tim doubted that thought.
Sparks from a passing train might have
been the cause but for some reason, perhaps
just a newspaperman’s intuition, he felt
that there was something sinister behind
the cause of the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it easy, we’re almost in,” shouted
Henshaw as he pointed to the lights of Vinton
as they swung around a curve.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim stuck his scoop into the coal pile
and straightened up for the first time since
he had taken the fireman’s place.</p>

<p class='c004'>The muscles in his back ached and his
arms were sore, but he felt that he had
earned his ride. His thoughts still on the
fire, he stepped over to the engineer’s side
of the cab.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anything of special value on tonight?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t know for sure,” replied Henshaw
as he eased up on the throttle. “There
were rumors back at Atkinson that there
was a lot of <em>specie</em> aboard for some coast
bank. Never can tell but the mail usually
has a pouch or two of valuable mail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim was silent as Henshaw guided the
mail through the maze of tracks that
marked the east entrance of the yards at
Vinton. Green and red lights blinked
out of the night at them.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was the hollow roar as they
rumbled past long lines of freight cars
on the sidings, the sharp exhaust of a laboring
switch engine, the multiple lights of
the roundhouse and finally the station itself
loomed in the rays of their headlight.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the far end of the big depot Tim
could see another engine waiting to be
hooked onto their train to continue the
mail’s dash for the coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henshaw cracked his throttle just
enough to bring them in with a flourish
and stopped his scorched string of mail cars
at the station on time to the second.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Tim dropped out of the cab he
was astounded to see Colonel Robert Searle,
head of the state police, striding toward
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello, Murphy,” said the officer,
“what’s this I hear about you fellows running
through a piece of burning timber?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s right, Colonel,” said Tim. “We
struck a patch about forty miles down the
line and it looked for a time like we weren’t
going to get through. Then Mr. Henshaw,
the engineer, decided to run for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You didn’t waste much time when you
first stopped for the fire did you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not any more than we had to,” said the
engineer. “The string of varnished cars
was stepping on a fast schedule.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then that explains why there wasn’t
a million dollar robbery on this line tonight,”
said the head of the state police.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Million dollar robbery!” exclaimed
Tim and the engineer. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just this,” explained Colonel Searle.
“There’s a million in cold cash back in one
of those mail cars. We got a tip after you
were out of Raleigh that there might be
trouble and there isn’t any question but
that the timber was set afire in an attempt
to stop the train. Whoever planned the
robbery figured that the train crew would
leave the train and go up for a closer view
of the fire. When you decided to back up
and run for it, you threw a monkey wrench
into their plans. It must have been a small
gang or they would have attempted to have
stopped you even then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our fireman is missing,” put in Tim.
“When we got the cinders out of our eyes
after dashing through the fire we found
Harry Benson gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe he was in with the gang,” suggested
Colonel Searle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not Benson,” said the engineer firmly.
“He’s one of the most loyal men on the line.
Only one thing could have happened to
him. He lost his balance and fell out the
gangway.” Tears were in the engineman’s
eyes and they were silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gray streaks of dawn were making their
appearance on the eastern sky when Tim
and the head of the state police left the mail
train.</p>

<p class='c004'>Railroad officials had indicated that they
would start an investigation of the cause
of the fire, but Colonel Searle informed
Tim that he intended to make his own inquiry.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were leaving the station when the
fresh engine which had been coupled on the
mail sounded the “high ball” and another
engineer took up the race for the coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went to a hotel were Ralph, who
had just dressed, greeted them. He wanted
to know all about the events of the night
and Tim painted a vivid word picture of
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll get something to eat,” said Colonel
Searle, “and then fly down the line and
take a look at that timber patch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think this may have something
to do with the old Sky Hawk gang?” asked
Tim, giving voice to a thought that he had
harbored for some time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like one of their fiendishly clever
jobs,” admitted the colonel, “and it’s just
about time for them to start something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later they were at the Vinton
airport, warming up the motor of the
<em>Good News</em>. The sun was just turning
the eastern sky into a warm, rosy dawn
when Tim gave the motor a heavy throttle
and sent the <em>Good News</em> winging off the
field.</p>

<p class='c004'>He swung the plane over Vinton, picked
up the twin tracks of the Southwestern and
headed back toward Atkinson. His hands,
sore and bruised from handling the heavy
scoop, ached as he held the controls of the
plane. Unconsciously he compared the
massive, brute power of the locomotive
with the graceful, birdlike machine he was
flying. Riding the cab of the mail had
been an experience he would never forget
but he was happy to be back in the clouds
on the trail of what promised to be another
sensational story.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rails twisted and turned through
the foothills and Tim marveled as he
thought of the speed they had made with
the mail, wondered how they had ever
stayed on the steel at the dizzying pace with
which they had split the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hills broadened out, wider valleys
appeared and it was in one of these that they
found the smouldering patch of timber
which had been an inferno of flame and
smoke only a few hours before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Railroad section men had already gathered
at the scene and Tim could see other
gasoline handcars speeding down the rails.
Ties would have to be replaced, new ballast
put in and the rails tested to make sure that
the heat had not warped them. Traffic on
the system must not be held up a minute
longer than necessary and the railroad men
were rallying to the emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim found a small meadow which was
large enough for a landing. He fish-tailed
the <em>Good News</em> into the field and set the
plane down lightly. They lashed it with
spare ropes which Tim carried in his own
cockpit and then started for the railroad,
a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Blackened stumps of trees reared their
heads into the gay sunlight of the spring
morning, grim reminders of the near tragedy.
Perhaps they were the only
headstones Harry Benson would ever have,
thought Tim, as he wondered if they would
find any trace of the fireman.</p>

<p class='c004'>A husky section boss told them to get
out and stay out but Colonel Searle displayed
his badge, which gave them access
to anything they wanted to see.</p>

<p class='c004'>The entire timber lot was not more than
four or five acres in extent. It had been
covered with a heavy growth of underbrush
and with the drought of the year before it
had been tender for any careless or intentional
match.</p>

<p class='c004'>Small patches of timber were still burning
but along the railroad right-of-way the
flames had either died down or had been
smothered by section men beating at them
with wet sacks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find anything of the fireman?” Tim
asked one of the workers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” replied the railroad man, “he’s
up the line a couple hundred feet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alive?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet. Got a broken leg but all right
outside of that,” grinned the man as he continued
beating a sack at a stubborn blaze at
the base of a stump.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim waited for no further question but
ran toward the far side of the timber lot
where a group of railroad men had gathered.
They were in a circle around someone
on the ground. The flying reporter
pushed them aside and looked down on the
scorched, smoke-blackened features of
Harry Benson. The fireman was in great
pain from his broken leg, but he was making
a brave attempt to smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello, reporter,” he said. The words
were close clipped and came from lips tense
with pain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello yourself,” said Tim. “We
thought you must have been thrown out
into the fire after we missed you last night.”
“Not me,” said the fireman. “It was a
close call but I didn’t get anything more
than a bad scorching. Who fired for the
rest of the run?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim held out his sore, cramped hands
and the railroad men joined in the fireman’s
laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Laugh all you want to,” smiled Tim,
“but I kept that kettle of yours hot and
Henshaw took her in on time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you happen to fall out of the
cab?” asked Colonel Searle, who had
joined the group around the fireman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was trying to get one more shovel of
coal into the old pot,” said Benson. “I misjudged
the distance and speed and was
caught half way between cab and tender
when we hit the fire. Figured I knew my
way back to my side of the cab and made
a jump for it. Instead of going where I
intended I dove out the gangway. Good
thing for me it only took us about five seconds
to run that fire or I’d have plunged
right into the center of it. I landed rolling,
hit a rock and broke my leg and have been
here ever since. Now we’re waiting for a
special that is coming down from Vinton
with a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Notice anything peculiar about the fire
while you were lying here?” asked the
officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only one thing,” admitted the fireman.
“It smelled kind of oily and the smoke was
mighty dark but my leg was hurting so
much I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the
fire except to worry for fear it might spread
and I wouldn’t be able to get out of the
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you hear any strange sounds?”
asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only once,” replied the fireman.
“Sounded sort of like a high-powered car
but when I didn’t hear it again I thought
I must have been going batty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t see anyone?” asked the colonel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not until some of these section hunkies
came chugging down the line,” said the
fireman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Satisfied that they could gain no additional
information from questioning the
fireman, Tim and Colonel Searle turned
away and joined Ralph to start a systematic
search of the blackened timber.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two reporters and the head of the
state police moved back and forth across
the timber, searching for something that
might indicate how the fire had started.
They covered the section of timber on the
right side of the railroad without result
and then crossed over the rails and resumed
their search on the left side.</p>

<p class='c004'>For half an hour they combed the
charred underbrush but without success and
they met on the far side of the timber lot
to discuss further plans.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Slim pickings,” commented the colonel.
“I haven’t found enough to hang on
a toothpick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About all I’ve got is an idea,” said Tim
as he started toward an old stream bed
which cut through the valley. The colonel
and Ralph, their curiosity aroused, followed
the flying reporter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The creek which ran through the valley
had changed its channel a number of times
and its old courses were filled with rubbish
which the wind had deposited. It was in
these old creek beds that Tim resumed his
search. He had not been hunting five
minutes when his cry brought the colonel
and Ralph to his side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Below them, hidden in the underbrush
of the old channel, they saw half a dozen
large tin containers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s how your fire was started,” said
Tim. “Someone doused the timber with
a generous supply of crude oil and how that
stuff does burn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They slid down the bank of the old
creek bed and Tim and Ralph pulled one
of the containers out where they could get
a better view.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Careful how you handle those,” warned
Colonel Searle, “and don’t move more
than one or two. I’ll have a fingerprint expert
out here to look them over. We may
find a valuable story in the fingerprints if
the chaps who started the fire got careless.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re not the type to overlook any
clues,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not as a rule,” conceded the colonel,
“but you must remember they wouldn’t
have figured in the state police being in on
this so soon. Believe me, it was a clever
stunt of theirs setting fire to the woods and
using that as a ruse to stop the mail. If it
hadn’t been for the determination of engineer
Henshaw to get his train through on
the new schedule on time, we’d have had
something to really worry about this morning.
If it had been a large gang they would
have attempted to stop you anyway so it
must have been a small, brainy outfit. Just
the type of fellows the Sky Hawk used to
have in his outfit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There were no identifying marks on the
containers and Tim and Ralph were careful
not to disturb more than the one they
had pulled into view.</p>

<p class='c004'>The whistle of the special from Vinton
sounded and when they climbed back to
the level floor of the valley, they saw the
stubby three car train grinding to a halt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Behind the engine were two cars loaded
with construction material, new rails and
ties and fresh ballast. The last car was a
passenger coach which was disgorging half
a hundred workmen. A doctor, nurse and
several railroad officials also got off the
rear car and hastened toward the injured
fireman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Benson will soon be out of his agony,”
said Tim. “What a night he must have
had, lying there with the flames all around
and practically helpless because of his
broken leg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A telegraph operator who had come
down on the special was busy shinning up
a telegraph pole to cut in his instrument and
place the scene of the fire in communication
with the dispatcher and other points
on the division.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to have that fellow telegraph
for our fingerprint expert to meet
you at Atkinson,” said the colonel. “You
boys fly back home, write your stories, and
bring him back. It will save hours over
the best train connections he could make,
and he may be able to read a surprising
story if there are any fingerprints on these
empty oil cans.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tim and Ralph left the colonel and started
for the <em>Good News</em>. On their way they
passed over a small, level piece of ground.
Two strange looking marks, about six feet
apart and from thirty to forty feet long,
attracted Tim’s attention and he stopped to
examine them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trying to read 'footprints in the sands
of time’?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not exactly footprints,” grinned Tim,
“but these marks didn’t just get here.
Someone made them and I’d like to know
what for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They look like those made by airplane
landing wheels,” suggested Ralph,
“but a plane couldn’t land or take off in
this short a space.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim studied the marks carefully and
then proceeded toward the <em>Good News</em>
without making any further comment on
his discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporters swung their plane
around and Ralph unblocked the wheels while
Tim warmed up the motor. Then they
sped away toward Atkinson, leaving the
charred and blackened remains of the timber
behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they landed at their home field,
the managing editor was waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s this about an attempt at a million
dollar robbery?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph looked at each other
blankly. They had not dreamed that the
news might have preceded them for they
thought the railroad people and the state
police were trying to keep it under cover.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you find out about it?” asked
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little birdie flew in and whispered in
my ear,” grinned the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The rumor is correct,” admitted Tim.
“Some gang set a patch of timber on fire
last night in an attempt to stop the mail
and get away with that shipment of money
to the west coast. The only thing that
averted the holdup was the quick action of
the engineer in deciding to run through the
fire and his speed in reversing his train and
backing up a mile to make a run for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must have been a thrill riding in the
cab when you shot through the flame and
smoke,” said Carson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Almost too much of a thrill,” conceded
Tim. “The fireman fell out of the cab
and broke a leg. I finished firing on the
run into Vinton and this morning they
found the fireman lying along the right-of-way.
He was suffering from shock. Lucky
thing for him the fire didn’t spread.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you’ve plenty of material for a
corking good yarn,” exclaimed Carson.
“Hop in the car and we’ll head for the
office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph told everything that had
taken place and the managing editor became
more enthused as their story progressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think it may be some members of
the old Sky Hawk gang?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got a hunch that it is,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That will make a fine angle to bring
into the story,” said Carson.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I mention that we suspect any of the
old gang, it will queer our chances of getting
them,” said Tim. “I’ll write you a
story every reader of the paper will find interesting
but I don’t want to give away
whom we suspect. Those oil cans back
there may have some fingerprints on them
that will prove valuable clues.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The managing editor finally agreed to
Tim’s wishes and when they reached the
<em>News</em> building Tim and Ralph went to
their typewriters and started writing their
stories.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim wrote the main story of the attempt
to rob the train, making it vivid with glowing
descriptions of the train’s race through
the flaming timber.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph wrote the story of the investigation
and then Tim dashed off a column
about the fireman who, his leg broken, had
laid along the right-of-way with the flames
threatening to bring his death.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both young reporters were alive to the
excitement of the hour and they breathed
their own interest into their stories. As a
result the copy they placed on the managing
editor’s desk was brilliant, readable material
of the kind that would make any
managing editor’s heart warm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carson read the stories with a quick eye,
pencil poised to mark out errors. But he
found none and when he had finished he
leaned back in his swivel chair and smiled
at Tim and Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another piece of fine work,” he said.
“Believe me, you boys can write.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stories like those don’t have to be written,”
said Tim. “They write themselves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Carson glanced at the clock. It was almost
noon.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better get some lunch if you’re going to
fly the fingerprint expert back to the scene
of the attempted robbery,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t have time to eat,” said
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll take time,” ordered the managing
editor. “After all the energy and brain
power you’ve used in writing these stories
you need to give your bodies food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now this is an assignment. Go down
to the Red Mill and order the biggest steaks
they have in the house. Take at least
forty-five minutes for your lunch and forget
to pay the check as you leave. They’ll
put it on my account. Mind now, I want
you to relax. Your minds will work much
better after you’ve had something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys promised they would obey the
managing editor’s instructions and went to
the Red Mill where they discussed the
events of the preceding hours over thick,
juicy steaks.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the flying reporters returned to
the airport, a thin, bespectacled young man
who carried a black brief case under one
arm was waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m Charlie Collins, fingerprint man
for the state police,” he told them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporters introduced themselves
and then turned to the manager of
the airport, who was standing nearby.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plane all ready to go?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything O. K.,” replied Hunter,
“And the sky’s clear all the way. There’s
a tail wind that will help all the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Faster the better,” grinned Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How fast will you travel?” asked the
fingerprint expert nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, about two hundred,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two hundred miles an hour!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” said Tim. “We can even do a
little better than that if you’re in such a
hurry to get down there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m in a hurry all right,” said Collins,
“but not 'two hundred miles an hour’ in
a hurry. I’ve never been up before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll like it,” said Ralph. “Greatest
thrill you’ll ever have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will it bump and jump around badly?”
asked the fingerprint expert.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rides smoother than a Pullman on a
day like this,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, since Colonel Searle ordered me
to come down with you, I’ll have to go,”
concluded Collins, “But I’d much rather
make the trip by auto or by train.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll like it once you’re up,” said
Tim as he helped the suspicious one into
the forward cockpit. Ralph buckled the
safety belt on their passenger and then fastened
his own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim flipped the wings, waggled the
stick, and they roared off the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the wheels left the ground, the
fingerprint expert let out a shriek that even
Tim could hear above the motor but as
soon as they were in the air, Collins’ nerves
settled and he started to enjoy his ride.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim shoved the throttle well ahead and
their air speed climbed to one hundred
eighty miles an hour. There were plenty
of clouds in the sky but there was a ceiling
of three thousand feet and Tim sent the
<em>Good News</em> dancing along.</p>

<p class='c004'>Almost before they knew it they were
circling down to land in the field they had
used earlier in the day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Searle was waiting to greet them
and he gave Charlie Collins a hand down
from the forward cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you like the ride?” Tim asked
the fingerprint expert.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was scared stiff at the start,” admitted
Collins, “but after we were off the ground
I enjoyed every minute of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thought you would,” smiled Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>They staked down the <em>Good News</em> and
then hurried across the railroad tracks and
on to the old creek bed where they had
found the empty oil containers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Collins took charge of the investigation
and Tim and Ralph sat down to watch him
work. The fingerprint expert moved
slowly and carefully, fearful lest he might
blot out some print that would be valuable.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every tin was examined and the fingerprints
recorded and filed for comparison
with the records at the headquarters of the
state police.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anything that looks familiar?” asked
Colonel Searle when Collins had finished
his task.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t be sure,” replied the expert.
“Some of them look like prints by the Sky
Hawk’s old crowd. I won’t know for sure
until I can get back to the records in the
office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph looked at each other
significantly. Here was another mention
of the Sky Hawk. The trail was getting
warmer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The railroad men had completed the
work of repairing the right-of-way where
it had been damaged by the fire, and trains,
delayed for hours, were on their way once
more. Transcontinental limiteds and long
strings of refrigerator cars were wheeling
down the steel as fast as their engineers
could roll them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Searle decided to ride back to
Vinton on one of the trains and requested
Tim and Ralph to take Collins to Atkinson
with them. This the flying reporters
agreed to do and in less than ten minutes
they were winging their way homeward,
passing train after train which seemed to
be little more than crawling along the twin
ribbons of steel.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they slid down out of the sky to
a perfect three point the sun was far down
in the west. Less than twenty-four hours
had elapsed since Tim had climbed into
the cab of the midnight mail at the union
station but many things had happened in
those few hours and more portended.</p>

<p class='c004'>A car was waiting at the field to whisk
the fingerprint expert away, but before Collins
left he promised to telephone the <em>News</em>
office whatever secrets the fingerprints
might unfold.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph helped the mechanics
wheel their plane into the hangar and then
started for the city. They had dinner and
then went to the <em>News</em> office to await whatever
word there might be from the fingerprint
expert.</p>

<p class='c004'>The building was deserted except for a
scrub-woman who was busy swishing her
mop around the desks in the business office
on the main floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph walked up to the editorial
office and switched on the lights over
their desks. The telephones, which kept
up an almost incessant clamor during the
daytime, were silent, sulking on the desks.
The electric printers which brought in the
news of the world in never ending sheets
of copy paper slept beneath their steel
hoods. It was strange how quiet the plant
could be at night. With the setting of the
sun its life seemed to drain away, only to
return again with the sunrise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim worked on his aviation column for
the next day while Ralph wrote a feature
on the speed with which the railroad crews
had repaired the right-of-way damaged by
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was mid-evening before the telephone
on Tim’s desk rang. The summons were
imperative.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim took the receiver off the hook and
his hand shook. Ralph stopped work and
came over to lean over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>The call was from the headquarters of
the state police. It was Collins, the fingerprint
expert, speaking.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The connection was poor and Tim was
forced to call the operator and ask for a
better wire. Finally they were able to hear
Collins distinctly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve checked up on the fingerprints,”
said the expert, “and they tally with those
of Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard, two
members of the old Sky Hawk gang!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim’s hand trembled as he heard the
words. Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard
were considered the two most dangerous
members of the gang next to the Sky Hawk
himself. The Hawk was gone but Sam
and Pierre were carrying on for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Collins talked steadily for several minutes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember how you chased the Sky
Hawk when he had the death ray?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c004'>“From all the dope I can get,” said Collins,
“Sam and Pierre were with the Hawk
that night, one of them in the plane itself
and the other waiting to help with the
getaway on the ground. Of course they’ll have
no scruples if you cross their path. In
fact, they would probably go out of their
way to meet you. Pleasant prospect, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not so pleasant,” replied Tim, “for
those chaps will stop at nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The reputation of Shanghai Sam and
Pierre Petard was known to every police
official in the central west. Petard had
served in the Allied aviation forces during
the war but he had later been revealed
as a German spy and had thrown his lot
with that of the Sky Hawk, former German
war ace. Shanghai Sam came from
the opposite end of the world, a white man
who had been king of the crooks in the far
east. When the middle west had offered
a richer field he had not hesitated to transfer
his activities and had joined the Sky
Hawk and his band.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you found any trace of either
of them, except the fingerprints, near the
scene of the attempted robbery?” asked
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I looked over the reports a few minutes
ago,” replied Collins, “and they must
have vanished into thin air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not so sure but what that’s exactly
what they did,” said Tim as he thought of
the queer marks he had found near the railroad
right-of-way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Collins warned them to be extremely
careful of their movements for the next
few days and then hung up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what do you think of that?”
asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just about what I expected,” said Tim,
“I was convinced that men trained under
the Sky Hawk were behind the attempt.
They are the only ones with the brains and
the daring to have thought of such a way to
stop the mail. The only thing that averted
a million dollar robbery last night was the
quick hand of engineer Henshaw and his
decision to run through the fire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The railroad ought to retire him on a
double pension,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t think he’d want to retire,” said
Tim. “He’s the kind who will stay at the
throttle until he is too old to stand the strain
of the high speed demanded today.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their conversation turned to what might
happen in the future and how best to protect
themselves against Shanghai Sam and
Pierre Petard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our best protection will be to keep on
the alert,” said Tim. “We’ll keep our
eyes open and our wits about us. In the
morning we’ll get some pictures of Sam and
Pierre from the state police and become
more familiar with their looks. They’ll
try another job in a few days and we’ll want
to be ready to cope with them in any emergency.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They left the office together and long
after Tim had gone to bed he thought of
the strange marks. They were connected
in some important way, he felt, with
Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next day Tim went to the public
library where he spent the morning reading
all that was available about Pierre Petard,
the former war hero. There was
nothing in the library about Pierre Petard
the criminal. Tim also read voluminously
about the development of airplanes
and of the many freak planes that had been
invented and of a few that had been made
to fly. There was a growing conviction
in his mind, but he was not yet prepared to
divulge it even to Ralph. It was so simple
that they might all laugh at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Tim returned to the office,
Captain Ned Raymond was talking to Ralph.
The captain had pictures of Shanghai Sam
and Pierre Petard for the flying reporters
to study.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll try something else soon,” asserted
the state police official, “and we’ll
rely on you boys to help us in running them
down. The railroad has offered a five
thousand dollar reward and it will be yours
if you bring about their capture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll do the best we can,” promised
Tim, “for the five thousand dollars would
come in handy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just two thousand five hundred dollars
apiece,” smiled Ralph. “What a lot of
ice cream that would buy,” he added.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond cautioned the flying
reporters against taking any undue chances
and warned them that the state police were
without a single clue as to where Sam and
Pierre were hiding.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll never find them in Atkinson,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not?” asked the police official.
“It’s the largest city in this part of the
state.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll never hide in any city,” said
Tim. “When you find them it will be in
some isolated section of the state, perhaps
in the valley of the Cedar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you any clues?” demanded Captain
Raymond.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nary a clue,” replied Tim, “but I’ve a
hunch and I believe in playing hunches.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond was about to leave
when one of the telephones on the copy
desk rang. They heard the copy-reader
who answered shout, “Bank Robbery!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words sent a chill of apprehension
through Tim and Ralph. Tim had been
convinced that the gangsters of the sky
would strike again but he had not expected
it would be within forty-eight hours after
their failure to rob the million dollar train.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What bank?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Citizens National,” replied the copyreader,
who was busy writing a bulletin in
longhand as the police reporter dictated the
story.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How much?” demanded Captain Raymond.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One hundred and ten thousand in cold
cash,” said the copyreader.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s go,” said Tim, and they dashed
for Captain Raymond’s car, which was
parked in front of the building.</p>

<p class='c004'>In five minutes they were at the Citizens
National Bank building, elbowing their
way through the crowd which had gathered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their state police badges got them past
the cordon of guards and they rushed into
the lobby.</p>

<p class='c004'>The robbery had been well planned and
executed. The two bandits had entered
the bank just before closing time and secreted
themselves in a washroom. Just as
the cashier was about to place the currency
in the vault, they emerged and covered the
employees with a sub-machine gun. One
of them took the money, stuffing it in a
brown leather portfolio. Then they
slipped out a side entrance and into a waiting
car. Twenty more seconds and they
were lost in the heavy traffic.</p>

<p class='c004'>A clerk had gathered his wits enough
to obtain the license and a brief description
of the car. It had been a black coupe,
low and powerful, with license No. 52-621.</p>

<p class='c004'>State police were scouring the highways
but so far there had been no report of the
car. Then came the news that the coupe
had been stolen only a few hours before
in a village fifty miles away and toward
the Cedar river.</p>

<p class='c004'>When that news reached the bank, Tim
determined to take up the chase in the
<em>Good News</em> and fifteen minutes after leaving
the bank the plane was soaring into the
sky.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The flying reporters headed into the east
toward the valley of the Cedar river.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim’s mind was working rapidly. The
robbery had all the signs of having been
done by Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard.
The smooth efficiency with which they had
worked and the perfection of their escape
pointed to the plans of men well versed in
crime.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> roared over the village
from which the bandit car had last been
reported and Tim swung the plane low.
Excited residents pointed down a road that
angled away to the right. Tim kept the
<em>Good News</em> low and they sped along the
country highway, every nerve tensed for
some glimpse of the bandit machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were not more than fifteen miles
from the village and in a desolate part of
the state when they saw smoke rising from
the highway ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a startled cry Tim realized what
had happened. The bandits’ car had been
wrecked and had then caught on fire. Even
though Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard
were villains of the deepest dye, he had no
desire to wish any man death under a flaming
car.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> circled slowly over the
twisted, red-hot wreckage of the machine.
There was no sign of life and Tim decided
to attempt a landing in a small, level space
nearby.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilot of the <em>Good News</em> brought his
ship down in the field and made a quick
stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, white-faced and shaking, turned
to face Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think they were caught in the
wreckage?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t tell,” replied Tim. “We’ll have
a look.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporters crashed through the underbrush
along the road and came upon the
smouldering remains of the car. They
made a careful survey but could find no
trace of anyone having been trapped under
the machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t tramp all over the road,” Tim
warned his companion. “There may be
some footprints we’ll want to follow. I’ve
a hunch this burning car was nothing more
than a clever ruse to throw pursuers off the
trail. We’ve wasted plenty of time landing
and getting over here. In the meantime,
the bandits are well on their way in
some other kind of a machine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They didn’t get away in a car,” said
Ralph. “Look at the road. There hasn’t
been a wagon or auto along since the light
rain last night. They’ve taken to the
brush.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll never find them in the brush,”
promised Tim. “They’re too clever for
that. A posse would smoke them out.
We’ll have a look around and see what we
can find.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They discovered the footprints of two
men but the marks looked as though someone
had made a hasty attempt to cover them
up. When the trail entered the brush the
footprints were soon lost to view.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll swing around the car in circles,”
said Tim. “In that way we ought to come
upon their trail somewhere. Keep an eye
on the direction it was headed when we
lost it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph nodded and disappeared in the
closely matted underbrush.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim could hear his companion’s footsteps
growing fainter and fainter until
they could be heard no longer. The flying
reporter moved carefully, eyes on the alert
for any sign which might give him some
clue on how the bandits had escaped after
wrecking and setting fire to their machine.</p>

<p class='c004'>He found what he was looking for in
a small clearing in the underbrush. There
were two parallel marks, spaced about six
feet apart, and extending for thirty or forty
feet. They were exactly like the marks
which he had found near the scene of the
attempted holdup of the midnight mail
only a few days before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim cupped his hands and called lustily
for Ralph. An answering cry came for a
distance and five minutes later Ralph
threshed his way through the heavy scrub.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at those,” Tim cried exultantly.
“Same thing we saw near the railroad
right-of-way after they tried to hold up
the mail train. When we find out what
they mean and what they were made by
we’ll have the secret of these robberies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They look like they had been made by
the wheels of an airplane,” said Ralph,
“but no plane could take off in such a short
distance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about an autogyro?” suggested
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good heavens,” exclaimed Ralph.
“I’ll bet you’ve got the solution.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I only wish I had,” smiled Tim, shaking
his head. “When I first saw those
marks the day after the burning of the timber
along the railroad right-of-way I
thought of an autogyro. When I looked
up their capabilities I found that they
wouldn’t fit into the picture. No, Ralph,
it’s not an autogyro.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But whatever makes those marks must
help them to escape,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can only guess at that,” Tim
warned him. “Those marks might, just
possibly, be coincidence and not be connected
with the bandits.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll never make me believe that,”
said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I probably never will myself,”
conceded Tim, “but I’m not going to take
anything for granted. We’re up against
something that is going to test our brains
and our nerves to the utmost.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young reporters continued their
search but after half an hour had discovered
nothing which would aid them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d better get back to our plane and
report where we found the bandit car,”
said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” agreed Ralph, “but before
we do I want to take a final look at the
wreck of their machine. It’s cooled off
somewhat and I’d like to look it over. There
may be some marks on the body that will
give us a clue.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind had been rising steadily and
was whipping through the underbrush,
whining a symphony all its own. Then
the young reporters caught a sudden alarming
smell of smoke and heard the crackling
of flames.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Someone must be near us,” said Ralph.
“I smell smoke and can hear a fire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words were hardly out of his mouth
when a sheet of flame, whipped by the
angry wind, leaped into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fire from the car has spread to
the underbrush,” cried Tim. “Quick,
Ralph, or we’ll be cut off from our plane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In another second their danger was
clearer. Some vagrant tongue of flame,
gnawing at the woodwork of the car, had
reached out and fired the underbrush. The
shower of the preceding night had been
only enough to dampen the dust of the
road and the brush and weeds were quickly
devoured by the spreading flames.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph raced through the underbrush,
tearing their clothes to shreds as
they crashed against stumps or fought their
way out of tangles of briars. Their faces
were scratched and bleeding but they did
not stop. Their life depended on their legs
and they used every ounce of their strength
in the grim race against the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flames were roaring hungrily, advancing
on them with a terrible certainty
of purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporters’ lungs ached cruelly as the
boys plunged on, gasping for the breath
that was needed to give them the strength
to continue. The clearing in which they
had left the <em>Good News</em> should be near at
hand but still they crashed through the
undergrowth. On and on they stumbled,
the crackling of the flames spurring them
to new effort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m all in,” gasped Ralph as he dropped
in a pitiful huddle. “Go on, Tim, go on!
I’ll make it out of here somehow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get up, Ralph, get up!” cried Tim as
he tugged at his companion’s limp body.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fire,” he screamed, “the fire! We
can’t stay here! We must go on!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph made a brave effort to get to his
feet and with Tim supporting him stumbled
on. Clouds of smoke billowed around
them, filling their lungs, and waves of heat
beat down upon them as the wind swept the
fire nearer and nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>With cries of relief they staggered into
the small, level place where they had left
the <em>Good News</em>. The biplane was waiting
for them, eager to sweep them up into the
air and away from the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys tumbled into their places and
Tim snapped on the switches. The motor
coughed once or twice and then roared into
its sweet, even song of power.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no time to turn the plane
around, no time to wonder if there was
room to take off. There was only time for
one thing; to jam the throttle wide open,
send the <em>Good News</em> roaring down the wind
and hope that she would lift clear of the
brush when the time came.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph snapped on his safety belt and
Tim secured himself in his own cockpit.
Then they were off, rocketing over the
uneven ground as the plane gained speed.
The powerful motor shattered the heavens
with its defiance of the flame and smoke
billowing after and lifted the plane clear
of the tangled underbrush which raised
its arms in a futile effort to entangle the
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys filled their lungs with the clear,
pure air of the upper regions as the <em>Good
News</em> started on the return trip to Atkinson.
Both Ralph and Tim were busy
thinking of the recent events and of their
discoveries at the scene of the wrecked car.
They were thankful for their escape, narrow
though it had been, from the brush
fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they landed at their home field
Tim went straight to the administration
building and telephoned news of the fire to
the state conservation office where steps
would be taken to send men to fight the
flames.</p>

<p class='c004'>After seeing that the <em>Good News</em> was
properly cared for the boys returned to the
<em>News</em> office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond was waiting for
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What news?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not very much,” replied Tim. “They
got away. We found their car, wrecked
and on fire, along a little used road.
Thought they might have been caught in
the wreckage and we landed nearby and
went to have a look. It was only a ruse
to throw us off the trail and slow up the
chase. They might have had another car
hidden nearby. At least we couldn’t find
any definite trace of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve checked up on the descriptions of
the men who robbed the Citizens National,”
said the state policeman, “and I’m
sure that Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard
did the job. Find them and we’ll rid the
middle west of a real menace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find them is right,” said Ralph.
“Looks to me like that is about the hardest
thing anyone around here ever tackled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think it is the hardest,” said Captain
Raymond grimly, as he got up to leave the
office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks a lot boys,” he said. “Too bad
you couldn’t have been in the air sooner
or you might have traced them from the
time they left the city.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s an idea,” said Tim. “We
could arrange to have one or the other of
us at the field all the time. When an
alarm comes in flash it to us there and the
<em>Good News</em> could be in the air in less than
five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good suggestion,” said Captain Raymond.
“I’ll see Mr. Carson at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lanky figure of the state officer disappeared
into the managing editor’s office
and Tim and Ralph looked at each other
and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If Carson will agree to a plan like that,
we’ll get somewhere,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why didn’t you tell him about the
strange marks we found?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wouldn’t do any good and besides I
want to do a little private sleuthing of my
own. We might just as well have that fat
reward the railroad people have out. The
bank may offer a sizeable sum and it won’t
be long until the capture of Shanghai Sam
and Pierre Petard will mean a small fortune.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond, accompanied by the
managing editor, came into the editorial
office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boys,” said Carson, “Captain Raymond
believes one of you should stay at
the airport all the time in case there are
any more robberies. I agree with him and
we’ll work out arrangements at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In less than an hour Tim was back at
the airport where he explained his needs
to the genial manager.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter agreed to put an extra cot in the
pilot’s room and Tim sent into town for
bed clothes and toilet articles he would
need. It had been decided that Tim would
take the night shift, sleeping at the field
while Ralph would remain there during
the day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporters soon settled into the new
routine. Hours lengthened into days and
there was no further word of the gangsters
who had robbed the Citizens National.
It was as though the world had swallowed
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The state police never relaxed their vigilance
and extended their tentacles into every
section of the state but without avail. No
one seemed to know where Shanghai Sam
and Pierre Petard had gone after they had
wrecked their car.</p>

<p class='c004'>The spring days faded into those of early
summer and Tim and Ralph were restless
under the routine which kept them on such
confining hours. They didn’t dare venture
away from the airport, yet both of
them had commenced to feel that their
steady vigil was of little avail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim continued to read avidly all of the
aviation journals he could buy as well as
spending considerable time looking into the
files of old technical magazines and heavy
volumes which he borrowed from the library</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim had returned to the field late in
the afternoon to relieve Ralph and they
were discussing plans for their summer vacation
when the telephone rang.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter summoned Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young reporter instantly recognized
the voice of Captain Raymond, tense with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another robbery,” he cried. “This
time there is no mistake. It was Shanghai
Sam and Pierre Petard. They weren’t even
masked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where was it?” cried Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At Hospers,” shot back the captain.
“They walked into the bank just before it
closed, made the employees shut the doors
right on time and then took an hour to thoroughly
loot the institution. First reports
indicate something over $50,000 in cash.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They don’t bother with chicken feed,”
exclaimed Tim. “What direction did they
head?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Toward the river valley!” cried the
captain. “My men are after them but you
may be able to spot them from the air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll start at once,” promised Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph, who had heard Tim’s excited
voice, was ready to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where to?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hospers,” replied Tim. “It’s that
little industrial town about fifteen miles
northeast of here. Sam and Pierre just
picked the bank clean and made a getaway.
Captain Raymond’s men are on their trail
but maybe we can spot them from the air
and force them to cover.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right,” agreed Ralph. “Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim stopped only long enough to snatch
a repeating rifle from a case on the wall of
the field manager’s office and then they
were on their way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> was ready for them and
Ralph climbed into the front cockpit.
Tim handed the rifle up to him and then
swung into his own place.</p>

<p class='c004'>The motor roared into action, blasted the
dust from under its wheels, and then flirted
them across the field and into the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim opened the throttle and the air
speed indicator went up to the one hundred
ninety mile an hour mark. In almost no
time they were over the town of Hospers
and the red-roofed buildings which comprised
its large farm machinery factory.
On into the east they sped, high enough to
get a commanding view of all the highways
for miles around.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim figured that the robbers had started
their escape less than half an hour before
and they should sight the bandit car soon
unless they had already taken to cover. Beneath
them powerful touring cars, loaded
with state troopers, were dashing madly
along the highways but there was no sign
of the machine they sought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph swept the countryside
with eyes trained for the slightest unusual
sign. They roared well ahead of the troopers
and then swung in ever widening circles
in their effort to find their quarry.</p>

<p class='c004'>A cry from Ralph fixed Tim’s attention
on a small smudge along the road ahead.
Something was on fire!</p>

<p class='c004'>The <em>Good News</em> dropped out of the sky
like an avenging eagle, motor whining and
wires shrieking. The plane hurtled
earthward in a power dive that made the fuselage
quiver and it was not until they were under
the five hundred foot level that Tim
brought the nose up and checked their mad
descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Below them was the body of a wrecked
automobile with flames licking at the cushions
and woodwork.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The fire’s just started,” cried Ralph.
“They can’t be far away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim nodded and set the <em>Good News</em>
down in a field a quarter of a mile back
from the road.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We may be able to get them this time,”
exulted Ralph as he leaped out of the front
cockpit, rifle in hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t see how they could be far away,”
admitted Tim. “The least we can do is
take a look at that wrecked machine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys broke into a fast trot and were
soon at the edge of the road where the
powerful touring car in which the bandits
had made their escape had been ditched.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Smells to me like they had taken some
gasoline out of the tank and thrown it over
the car,” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim had been making a quick survey of
the road. It was a graveled highway and
there were no footprints to give them a clue
on which direction the robbers had fled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d better get back to the <em>Good News</em>
and get into the air again,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The words were hardly out of his mouth
when they heard the motor of the <em>Good
News</em> break into its familiar song.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ve tricked us!” cried. Tim.
“They’re stealing our own plane!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The reporters plunged madly toward the
field in which they had left their plane
but before they had covered half the distance
they saw the <em>Good News</em> shoot into
the air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph and Tim, weeping with rage,
watched their plane gain altitude and then
circle over them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilot leaned far out and waved derisively.
Ralph’s answer was to drop on
one knee and send a stream of well directed
bullets at the plane overhead.</p>

<p class='c004'>They could see the bullets rip through
the wings. Ralph, aiming at the propeller,
was undershooting his mark. If he could
land just one good shot in the whirling
blade, it would disable the plane and bring
the bandits back to earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph exhausted the supply of
ammunition in the magazine of his rifle and was
helpless as the bandits headed the <em>Good
News</em> in an easterly direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What chumps we were, knowing they
couldn’t be far away, to leave the <em>Good
News</em> unguarded,” mourned Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We may have to hunt for new jobs
when Carson hears of this,” added Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not thinking of that so much as I
am the humiliation,” said Tim. “Here
the state police feel that we are reliable and
brainy enough to help them and then we
go and pull a boner like this. I’ll tell Carson
what happened if you’ll tell Captain
Raymond and Colonel Searle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here comes the captain now,” said
Ralph as a touring car, loaded with state
police, skidded to a stop in the gravel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get them?” cried Captain Raymond.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They got us,” said Tim. “We spotted
their burning car and landed to have a
look. While we were hunting around their
wrecked machine they slipped behind us
and stole the <em>Good News</em>. If you look east,
you may see a speck against the clouds.
That’s the <em>Good News</em> and they’re in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond stared incredulously
at Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean to tell me you let them steal
your plane?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid that’s about right,” put in
Ralph. “We didn’t exactly offer them the
plane but they helped themselves anyway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond broke into a hearty
laugh, but stopped abruptly as he saw the
expressions on the faces of Tim and Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You wouldn’t blame me for laughing,”
he said, “if you could have seen the woebegone
looks on your faces just now. Come
on, cheer up. They pulled a fast one on
you this time but they won’t do it again.
We were pretty close this time; next time
we’ll be close enough so we can land them
in jail. Pile into the car, boys and we’ll
swing further east, picking up what information
we can on the direction in which
they are heading.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Twenty-five miles east of the place
where the bandits had stolen the <em>Good
News</em>, Tim, Ralph and the state police
came upon the crumpled remains of the
plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>From all indications the bandits had
landed safely, then opened the throttle and
sent the <em>Good News</em> charging into a clump
of trees. The wings of the crimson plane
had folded back along the fuselage, the propeller
was splintered into a thousand bits
and it was generally ready for the scrap
heap.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim went wild with rage and wept in his
futile anger. When he finally calmed
down it was with a quietness that foreboded
no good for Shanghai Sam and Pierre
Petard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can’t learn anything more by inspecting
what’s left of the <em>Good News</em>,” he
said. “Let’s circle around and see if we
can find trace of a car they might have
had waiting for them to make their getaway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond agreed that Tim’s
suggestion was a good one and the state
police spread out in their search for clues.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Ralph, working together,
found the only clue of the afternoon. Half
a mile beyond the wreckage of the <em>Good
News</em> they found two marks, about six feet
apart and nearly forty feet long, in a small
field which was hidden from the nearest
road by a heavy growth of trees. Tim
made a careful inspection of the marks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That settles it,” he said finally. “I’m
going east tonight and when I come back
we’ll make it hot for the fellows who stole
the <em>Good News</em> and then deliberately
crashed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they returned to Atkinson, Tim
carried his story to the managing editor and
Carson was wrathfully indignant. He had
no word of censure for his flying reporters.
Instead, he praised them for their daring
and urged them to new efforts in the detection
of Shanghai Sam and Pierre Petard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m playing a long hunch,” said Tim,
“but I feel that if I can go east tonight,
I’ll be able to learn information there that
will bring about the arrest of this pair of air
pirates.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go as far as you like, Tim,” said the
managing editor, “just as long as you deliver
the goods.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks, Mr. Carson. I’ll leave on
the early night train for New York.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph helped Tim throw a few things
in a traveling bag and saw his flying companion
to the union station and aboard the
limited which would carry him on his quest
for new clues.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s clicking in the old bean?”
Ralph asked as they stood beside the Pullman.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just a wild hunch,” said Tim, “and I
don’t want to be laughed at if it goes wrong.
That’s why I’m keeping it under my hat.
If there is anything to it, you’ll be the first
to find out. And say, while I’m away, beg
a plane off Carl Hunter and have it ready
when I return. We may need a ship in
a hurry. We’ve done plenty of favors for
Carl and he’ll be glad to help us out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll have a ship ready before you’re
back,” promised Ralph as Tim swung up
on the steps of the slowly moving train.
“Good luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The limited picked up speed and its tail
lights vanished as Ralph stood on the
platform, wondering what queer mission had
taken Tim east so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thirty-six hours after leaving Atkinson
Tim awoke to find his train pulling into
the outskirts of New York. The steam
locomotive was uncoupled from the long
string of Pullmans and an electric engine
took its place at the head of the train for
the few remaining miles into the heart of
the city. The train picked up speed rapidly
and rolled steadily into Manhattan, hesitating
only a moment before it plunged into
the darkness of the tunnel under the river.
Then they were in the great terminal,
where trains were arriving or departing
continuously throughout the day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim went to a hotel the managing editor
had recommended and after leaving his
traveling bag set forth in quest of the information
which he felt would result in
the apprehension of Shanghai Sam and
Pierre Petard and put an end to the series
of crimes which they had carried out successfully
in the middle west.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter’s first call was at
the office of the largest aircraft manufacturer
in the United States. After some insistence
he was admitted to the office of
Herman Bauer, the chief designer, a quiet,
gray-haired man. In a few words Tim
explained his mission.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad you came to us,” said Bauer.
“I’ve been reading of these robberies and
once or twice the stories have mentioned
how completely the bandits disappear and
that the only marks they leave behind are
those parallel lines in small clearings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you’ve guessed what they must
be using?” asked Tim eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” assented Bauer, “but I’m afraid
I can’t help you much more than to say that
I believe you’re on the right track. Our
company doesn’t go in for that sort of thing
and if we did we’d have to have assurance
that the machine would be used legally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hardly expected that your firm was
involved in any way,” explained Tim, “but
with your knowledge of the companies
capable of doing such a job I thought you
might be able to give me some valuable
leaders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t off hand,” replied the designer,
“but if you’ll come back this afternoon I’ll
make some inquiries in the meantime and
may have information that will help you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim thanked the aviation expert and
passed the remaining hours of the morning
walking through the streets of busy, restless
New York.</p>

<p class='c004'>At two o’clock he returned to Herman
Bauer’s office. The designer greeted Tim
cordially and turned to introduce a younger
man who was in his office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want you to know Mac Giddings,”
he told Tim. “Mac is one of my assistants
and has managed to uncover some information
that should help you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and the assistant designer shook
hands cordially. They were of the same
type, tall and slender, with a seriousness of
purpose that brought an immediate and
warm friendship.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve heard rumors for some time that
a little company back in the Jersey mountains
was up to some kind of a trick that
wasn’t altogether above board,” said Giddings.
“One of our draughtsmen was fired
by them but before he left he saw enough
of the plans to see what they had in mind.
If you say the word, we’ll hop in my car
and drive out. We can make it before
sundown.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim agreed to the assistant designer’s
suggestion and they were soon threading
their way through the heavy mid-afternoon
traffic. Once out of the heart of the city
they struck a thoroughfare and sped across
the Jersey flats.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter told his new friend
of their experiences with Shanghai Sam
and Pierre Petard and gave him an outline
of his own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems to me you’ve found the solution,”
said Giddings as he swung his machine
off the main highway. “And I
wouldn’t be surprised if we verify it within
the next two or three hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The roads became rougher and their car
labored up steep grades. Farm houses
looked less prosperous and by six o’clock
they had reached a section of Jersey with
which few people were familiar. They
were almost to the Pennsylvania line in a
wild, sparsely settled region.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d better leave my car here,” said
Giddings, “and go the rest of the way on
foot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He drove his car behind a thicket that
screened it from the view of any chance
passerby and they continued their journey
afoot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later they topped a ridge
and looked down on a valley, flanked on
each side by small clearings. To the right
of the creek were several frame houses
while on the left side was a wide, low building,
half frame, half canvas, which could
be nothing but a hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it easy,” cautioned Giddings.
“These people don’t like strangers and
they’re apt to shoot first and ask questions
afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and the assistant designer made
their way toward the clearings with great
caution. Fortunately they were on the left
bank of the stream and would not have to
cross it in order to reach the hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>A small crew of mechanics who had been
at work in the hangar came out of the
building and made their way across the
rough bridge and to one of the houses which
evidently was used as a mess house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now’s our chance,” whispered Giddings
as he moved toward the hangar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t need to go,” said Tim, grabbing
at his companion. “There is no need
for you to take any chances. This is my
game and I can see it through now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve voted myself in on it,” said Giddings.
“Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They moved quietly through the underbrush
and made their way toward the rear
of the hangar. There they stopped and
listened to make sure that no one had been
left on guard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All clear,” whispered Tim. “I’m
going in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter found a place where
he could wiggle under the canvas wall at
the rear of the hangar. Giddings was right
behind him and when they stood up it was
to look upon the most unusual workshop
either of them had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Workbenches and lathes were along the
walls of the makeshift hangar but the object
which held their attention was the
monoplane in the center.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m right!” exclaimed Tim jubilantly,
“I’m right!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You sure are,” agreed Giddings. “I’m
going to have a look at this contraption.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The monoplane was the strangest plane
either of them had ever seen. They
pinched themselves to make sure that they
were not dreaming for it was such a bizarre
looking craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Old Man Bauer will have a fit when he
hears about this,” chuckled Giddings, “for
he has always had a pet theory that this type
of machine would never fly. Said you
couldn’t get enough power into the wing
propellers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to try it,” said Tim as they
started a quick inspection of the monoplane.</p>

<p class='c004'>The machine had been camouflaged by
an expert. On the ground it would have
been invisible from the air while in the air
it would be practically invisible from the
ground, so cleverly had the colors been
mixed and camouflage been applied. But
the feature of the monoplane which drew
their attention was the wing propellers. At
the outer tip of each wing were mounted
horizontal propellers, each about four feet
in diameter. Small, powerful air cooled
motors supplied the power for the wing
propellers while a standard whirlwind was
the motive power for the main propeller in
the nose of the ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Talk about autogyros,” exclaimed
Tim. “Why this thing could take off and
land in a flower bed. I’ll bet those wing
propellers can pull it almost straight up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the theory,” said Giddings, “and
from the robberies that this gang you’re
after has been getting away with successfully
it looks to me like they’ve been using
one of these machines, probably the first
one this outfit ever turned out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When I first saw those parallel tracks
after the attempt to rob the midnight mail
I figured they must be using some kind of
a machine like this,” said Tim, “but I knew
it would have to be more efficient than anything
sold on the commercial market.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s get out of here before dark,” said
Giddings. “We’ve got a long trip back
to the city and we can discuss plans on our
way back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim agreed and they made their way
out of the hangar and back to the car without
detection.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the trip to New York Tim discussed
plans for the capture of Shanghai Sam and
Pierre Petard with the young aircraft designer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got something I’ve been fooling
with for a long time,” said Giddings. “It’s
a sort of radio detector designed for use in
time of war. When it is fitted into a plane
you can ascertain whether any other ships
are in the air and by adjustment of the
detector tell how far away they are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just the thing I’ll need,” said Tim
enthusiastically. “Is there any chance that
you’ll lend it to me for a few days?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s why I mentioned it,” said Giddings.
“The device needs a thorough testing
and once I’ve proved its value I’ll have
no trouble in selling my patents. We’ll
both profit by your using it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When they reached the city Giddings
drove to his apartment, which contained
living quarters and a room which he had
fitted up as an electrical laboratory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Far into the night they worked in the
laboratory, Giddings explaining the use of
his radio detector and Tim working with
it to be sure that he could handle it to the
best advantage.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the flying reporter left Giddings’
apartment he was burdened with the radio
detector, which, although placed in a
compact cabinet, was heavy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to report this outfit over in
the Jersey woods,” said Giddings, “and it
won’t take Uncle Sam long to put a damper
on their activities. There will be no objection
to their manufacture of their plane
for commercial use but to make them especially
for aerial bandits is a proposition
that Uncle Sam won’t stand for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad you’ll take care of that,” said
Tim. “They really have a wonderful
plane and it’s a shame that a crooked outfit
has gotten hold of it. Undoubtedly money
which the Sky Hawk obtained when he was
at the peak of his career is behind them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which will be just one more reason
why Uncle Sam will be glad to shut them
up,” said Giddings. “By tomorrow afternoon
the woods will be full of federal men
for a surprise raid. Be sure and let me
know how you come out and send the radio
detector back as soon as you’re through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll do that,” promised Tim, “and
thanks so much for all you’ve done for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When the flying reporter reached his
hotel, he found a telegram.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve been trying to find you since
late afternoon,” said the clerk who handed
him the message. “It was marked important.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim tore open the yellow envelope and
read the brief message. His senses reeled
as the import of the telegram flashed
through his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph had been kidnapped!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The message, from the managing editor
of the <em>News</em>, was brief and to the point.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ralph kidnapped this afternoon. Come
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The shocking news paralyzed Tim’s
brain and he leaned helplessly against the
clerk’s desk, his face drained of all color.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you ill?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I’ll be all right in a minute,” Tim
managed to say. “Just some surprising
news from my managing editor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flying reporter went to a nearby
lounge and sat down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph kidnapped.</p>

<p class='c004'>It must be impossible; it was impossible,
he told himself. Yet there was the telegram
from Carson—so simple and yet so
startling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ralph kidnapped this afternoon.
Come home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They needed him in Atkinson and Tim
pulled himself together and went to the
desk to inquire about the air passenger
service west.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can get a plane at seven in the
morning,” said the clerk. “By changing
at Dearborn you’ll land at Atkinson at
five in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Telephone my reservation,” said Tim
and he turned to hasten to his room.</p>

<p class='c004'>He partially undressed and threw
himself on the bed, still dazed from the
shock of the telegram.</p>

<p class='c004'>What could Ralph have been doing;
what had he run into that had resulted in
his kidnapping? Who would want to kidnap
him and how had they done it? These
and a dozen other questions raced through
Tim’s tired mind. Finally, in complete
physical and mental exhaustion, he dropped
into a sound sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Afternoon of the following day found
Tim disembarking from the mail and passenger
plane at his home airport. Carson
and the field manager were waiting to greet
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s this about Ralph being kidnapped?”
demanded Tim, to whom the hundred
and ten mile an hour schedule of the
passenger plane had seemed slow as they
winged their way westward from New
York.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There isn’t a whole lot to tell,” said
the managing editor. “The day after you
left Ralph took one of the cars and headed
for Cedar river valley. Said he had a
hunch that the bandits had a hideout there
and that he might improve his time while
you were away by making a sort of a lone
search for them. He was still boiling mad
over their stealing the <em>Good News</em> and
cracking it up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I feel that way myself,” said Tim. “Go
on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ralph never got to the valley,” said
Carson. “In fact, he didn’t get more than
fifty miles from Atkinson. The first we
knew he was in trouble was a report late in
the afternoon of one of our cars being
found abandoned on a road east of here and
on the way to the valley I knew it was the
machine Ralph had taken and personally
headed the investigation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you find?” asked Tim breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Signs of a hard scrap,” said the managing
editor. “Ralph must have stumbled
on Sam and Pierre or they might have been
trailing him. It was along a lonely road
with lots of underbrush nearby.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anything to show that Ralph was
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There were several bullet marks in
the body of the car but there was no sign
of blood,” said the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find anything else?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some peculiar marks in a clearing nearby.
They were similar to those you reported
at railroad fire and bank robbery.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was sure those marks would be there,”
mused Tim. “Well, one thing sure,” he
added, “Sam and Pierre are about at the
end of their string. I know what they’ve
been using to make their escapes and have
the means of detecting them the next time
they come into the open.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim told Carson and Hunter of his visit
to the aircraft company in New York and
how the chief designer and Mac Giddings
had helped him, of the discovery of the
secret airplane factory in the Jersey woods
and of the marvelous plane that they had
developed. Then he explained the radio
detector which Mac Giddings had perfected
and his plan for catching Shanghai
Sam and his companion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It sounds O. K.,” said the managing
editor enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got a plane here at the field you
can equip,” volunteered the field manager.
“I’ll have the mechanics start getting it in
shape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Throughout the night Tim remained
at the airport, supervising the installation
of the radio detector in the fast biplane
which Hunter provided for his use.</p>

<p class='c004'>By dawn the plane was ready to go.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you going to do now?” asked
the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Start a steady patrol of the Cedar river
valley,” said Tim. “When I get tired
Hunter has agreed to relieve me. We’ll
both ride the plane and only come down
when we need gas and oil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t they get suspicious of what
you’re up to?” asked the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I doubt it,” said Tim. “We’ll be up
ten to twelve thousand feet all the time
and with the muffler Carson has fitted on
the exhaust they won’t be able to see or
hear us on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And will the radio detector work at
that height?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Giddings said it was good up to twenty
thousand feet,” replied Tim. “At least
it is the best we have and if it does work
we’ll soon put an end to these marauders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An hour later the silver-gray biplane
which they had equipped was cruising over
the Cedar river valley. The altimeter
showed 10,000 feet and Tim throttled
down the engine as he started the patrol of
the valley. Hunter, in the forward cockpit,
had a headset on and was listening for
some sound in the radio detector.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through the hours of the morning they
maintained their vigil and at noon flew
halfway back to Atkinson to land at an
air mail emergency field and refill their
gasoline tanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll take the controls this afternoon,”
said Hunter, and Tim agreed to the suggestion.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they were near the valley again
Tim set the radio detector going. There
was a low, steady hum in the earphones for
the noise of their own motor was cut out
of the set’s pickup.</p>

<p class='c004'>At two o’clock a sound came through
the earphones that electrified Tim.
Hunter, in the rear cockpit, could see Tim’s
body tense as the flying reporter bent over
the detector and adjusted the dials for more
delicate tuning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhere below them the motor of a
powerful plane was being warmed up!</p>

<p class='c004'>The roaring in the earphones was strong;
then weak, as their own biplane swung
away from the source of the sound. By
following the path of the strongest sound
they would be able to find their quarry and
Hunter watched Tim’s hand carefully for
directions on how to pilot the plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they reached the center of a dense
forest along the right bank of the Cedar
the roaring was loud and steady. They
were still up eight thousand feet and too
high to see what was going on below. Tim
took a pair of field glasses out of a case
and leaned over the side of the ship while
Hunter banked the biplane in easy circles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The powerful lenses made the ground
leap toward them and Tim could see every
object clearly. He gasped as his glasses
focused on a clearing in one of the densest
parts of the forest.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was looking down on an exact replica
of the plane he had seen in the makeshift
hangar in the Jersey woods only two days
before. The upper wings, as he had expected,
were carefully painted so that detection
from the sky was almost impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under normal conditions Tim and Hunter
could have flown low over the clearing
without seeing the plane but thanks
to the radio detector they had been able to
spot it with little trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter shut off the motor and leaned
toward Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are they doing?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Getting ready to take off,” shouted
Tim. “They’re climbing into the plane.
Here they come!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“See anything of Ralph?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, but there’s a small shack on one
side of the clearing and he is probably in
there. We’ll take care of these chaps first
and then drop down and see where they’ve
hidden Ralph.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter snapped on the switch and the
motor roared into action again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim kept his glasses trained on the plane
below. The wing motors had been started
and the ship, after a run of thirty or forty
feet, was rising almost vertically. It was
a beautiful take-off and Tim knew that the
master hand of Pierre Petard was at the
controls.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll let them get out of the forest
country,” Tim shouted at Hunter. “If we
swoop down on them now we’ll have them
sneaking into some small clearing where
we can’t follow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right,” cried Hunter as he swung his
biplane westward and took up the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c004'>For half an hour the strange game of
hunted and hunter continued with Tim and
Hunter keeping five to six thousand feet
above the other ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they were finally over open country
Tim motioned for Hunter to give his
plane the gun and the field manager, anxious
for action, opened the throttle and sent
his ship thundering downward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim opened a black leather case in the
forward cockpit and swung a sub-machine
gun over the side of the plane. They had
come prepared for any emergency for both
of them realized that the men they sought
would stop at nothing to make their escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>The biplane shrieked down on its unsuspecting
quarry, flashing out of the
heavens like an avenging eagle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Intuition must have caused Pierre Petard
to glance over his shoulder just in time to
see Hunter preparing for the final swoop.
They saw Pierre reach quickly and tap Sam
on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly the man in the forward cockpit
turned and in another second a light machine
gun, similar to the one Tim held,
belched a stream of bullets at them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sam’s aim was good and the bullets
traced a wicked line along one wing, coming
ever closer to the fuselage. But it was
for only a second.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter was a master of the air and he
sent his plane into a screaming dive that
ended only when he was under the other
plane and in a position for Tim to pour
a hail of bullets into the fuselage of the
ship above them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bandit plane veered sharply and for
a second Tim had a clear shot at the propeller.
The bullets from the machine gun
shattered the whirling blade and the air
was full of bits of wood.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter pulled his own ship into the clear
and they watched anxiously while Pierre
attempted to bring his damaged plane to
a safe landing. It fluttered down like a
crippled bird, turning this way and that,
now limping along for a few feet and then
abruptly dropping away until it seemed inevitable
that it should end in a deadly tailspin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll make it all right,” cried Tim.
“They’re heading for that big pasture,”
and he pointed to a large field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter gave the biplane full throttle
and sped earthward at a daredevil pace.
They must beat the bandit ship down.
The field manager sideslipped into the pasture
and set his plane down hard. Tim
leaped from the cockpit, his machine gun
freshly loaded and ready for action. Hunter,
a repeating rifle in hand, joined him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bandit plane was staggering down
toward the field. It barely cleared the
fence and bounced toward them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get back of this ridge,” Tim warned
Hunter. “They may try to shoot it out
and we’d make good targets out here in
the open.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hunter agreed and they sought shelter
behind a low ridge along the edge of the
field.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bandit plane rolled on and on. They
could see Pierre working desperately at the
controls.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The wing motors,” cried Tim. “He’s
trying to start them. If he does they’ll
get away from us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep down,” warned Hunter, “I think
the burst of bullets you put into their ship
disabled the controls to the wing motors
or he’d have used them before he landed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The bandit plane finally rolled to a stop
less than two hundred feet away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come out with your hands up!” ordered
Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The answer was a flicker of flame from
the forward cockpit, the staccato of a machine
gun and the thud of bullets into the
dirt which protected them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim answered instantly, his machine
gun tracing a steady, deadly line along the
fuselage. Hunter pumped shell after
shell into his repeating rifle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The firing from the plane ceased abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll come out,” cried a weak voice
and Pierre Petard stood up in his cockpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim and Hunter moved forward cautiously,
fearing a ruse, but they found that
Shanghai Sam had been wounded in the
shoulder in the last exchange of shots and
Pierre, knowing that the end of his career
was near, was white and shaken.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is the reporter you kidnapped?”
demanded Tim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Back in the clearing where we made
our headquarters,” replied Pierre. “We
didn’t harm him,” he added as though fearing
Tim might manhandle him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If he is,” promised the flying reporter,
“I’ll give you something to remember me
by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Shanghai Sam refused to talk and
Hunter went to the nearest highway where
he stopped a motorist. Within an hour
Captain Raymond and a detail of state
police were on the scene, ready to take
charge of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tim, relieved of the responsibility of
capturing the sky pirates, hastened to a
farmhouse where he telephoned the story
to the <em>News</em>. Carson, the managing editor,
was jubilant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how about Ralph?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“State police are on their way to get him
now,” said Tim. “The whole case will
be cleaned up in another hour or two.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Splendid,” exclaimed the managing
editor. “We’re going on the street with
an extra now with the <em>News</em> taking full
credit for the capture of those fellows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Early that evening Tim and Ralph were
reunited in the <em>News</em> office. They had
much to tell and they had an interested
audience in their managing editor, the field
manager and the members of the <em>News</em>
staff.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ralph told how he had been on his way
to the Cedar river valley when he had seen
the bandits bring their plane down in a
small clearing near the highway. Ralph
had left his car to make a closer inspection
but had been discovered by Pierre and Sam.
He had fled to his car but had been captured
before he could make his escape. He
had been forced into the bandit plane and
taken to their hiding place in the wilderness
of timber and underbrush in the river
valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They took good care of me,” grinned
Ralph, “but I realized that when they completed
their series of daring robberies they
would probably leave me tied up in the
shack, which wasn’t such a pleasant prospect.
The money they had obtained in
their robberies was all in the shack and
believe me I was sure happy when the state
police arrived.”</p>

<p class='c004'>From New York came a telegram from
Mac Giddings congratulating Tim on the
use of the radio detector and adding that
federal agents had raided the hidden
factory in the Jersey woods, seizing all men
and equipment. Giddings added that his
own company was making arrangements to
take over the plans and manufacture the
new plane on a commercial basis.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At least some good will come from this
whole affair” said Tim. “The plane was
truly a marvel. It’s too bad that it had
to have its first test in this fashion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond made his way into the
room. A stranger was with him but Tim
recognized the man as the chief executive
of the state, Gov. Ned Turner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Raymond introduced Tim and
Ralph to the governor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When Captain Raymond told me all
of the fine things you two have done in
capturing these sky pirates I wanted to tell
you in person how much this means to the
state. It is a real privilege to commission
you as honorary life members of the state
police.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Tim and Ralph were finally alone
with their managing editor, they confessed
their extreme fatigue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What you need is a good rest,” said
Carson. “You’ll get the $5,000 reward
the railroad offered, the banks should pay
you handsomely and the paper is going to
give each of you a bonus of a month’s pay.
You’d better take a vacation and spend a
little of that money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds good to me,” said Tim. “What
do you say to accepting the invitation Hank
Cummins extended to visit at the Circle
Four ranch for a month?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Make it unanimous,” smiled Ralph.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you can plan on leaving the first
part of the week,” said the managing
editor. “In the meantime we’ll see about
buying a plane to replace the <em>Good News</em>
for I know neither of you will be happy
until then.”</p>
